"The :mod:`pickle` module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-"
"serializing a Python object structure.  *\"Pickling\"* is the process "
"whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and "
"*\"unpickling\"* is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a :"
"term:`binary file` or :term:`bytes-like object`) is converted back into an "
"object hierarchy.  Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as "
"\"serialization\", \"marshalling,\" [#]_ or \"flattening\"; however, to "
"avoid confusion, the terms used here are \"pickling\" and \"unpickling\"."

"The :mod:`pickle` module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or "

"Python has a more primitive serialization module called :mod:`marshal`, but "
"in general :mod:`pickle` should always be the preferred way to serialize "
"Python objects.  :mod:`marshal` exists primarily to support Python's :file:`."
"pyc` files."

msgid ""
"The :mod:`pickle` module differs from :mod:`marshal` in several significant "
"ways:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pickle.rst:47
msgid ""
"The :mod:`pickle` module keeps track of the objects it has already "
"serialized, so that later references to the same object won't be serialized "
"again. :mod:`marshal` doesn't do this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pickle.rst:51
msgid ""
"This has implications both for recursive objects and object sharing.  "
"Recursive objects are objects that contain references to themselves.  These "
"are not handled by marshal, and in fact, attempting to marshal recursive "
"objects will crash your Python interpreter.  Object sharing happens when "
"there are multiple references to the same object in different places in the "
"object hierarchy being serialized.  :mod:`pickle` stores such objects only "
"once, and ensures that all other references point to the master copy.  "
"Shared objects remain shared, which can be very important for mutable "
"objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pickle.rst:60
msgid ""
":mod:`marshal` cannot be used to serialize user-defined classes and their "
"instances.  :mod:`pickle` can save and restore class instances "
"transparently, however the class definition must be importable and live in "
"the same module as when the object was stored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pickle.rst:65
msgid ""
"The :mod:`marshal` serialization format is not guaranteed to be portable "
"across Python versions.  Because its primary job in life is to support :file:"
