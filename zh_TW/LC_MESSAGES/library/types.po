msgid ""
"This module defines names for some object types that are used by the "
"standard Python interpreter, but not for the types defined by various "
"extension modules. Also, it does not include some of the types that arise "
"during processing such as the ``listiterator`` type. It is safe to use "
"``from types import *`` --- the module does not export any names besides the "
"ones listed here. New names exported by future versions of this module will "
"all end in ``Type``."

"Typical use is for functions that do different things depending on their "
"argument types, like the following::"

"Starting in Python 2.2, built-in factory functions such as :func:`int` and :"

"preferred way to access the type instead of using the :mod:`types` module. "
"Accordingly, the example above should be written as follows::"
