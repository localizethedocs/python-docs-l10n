"This module provides a :class:`ModuleFinder` class that can be used to "
"determine the set of modules imported by a script. ``modulefinder.py`` can "
"also be run as a script, giving the filename of a Python script as its "
"argument, after which a report of the imported modules will be printed."

"This class provides :meth:`run_script` and :meth:`report` methods to "

"*debug* sets the debugging level; higher values make the class print  "
"debugging messages about what it's doing. *excludes* is a list of module "
"names to exclude from the analysis. *replace_paths* is a list of ``(oldpath, "
