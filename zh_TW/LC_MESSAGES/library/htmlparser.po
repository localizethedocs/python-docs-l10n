"The :mod:`HTMLParser` module has been renamed to :mod:`html.parser` in "
"Python 3.0.  The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when "
"converting your sources to 3.0."

"This module defines a class :class:`HTMLParser` which serves as the basis "
"for parsing text files formatted in HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language) and "
"XHTML. Unlike the parser in :mod:`htmllib`, this parser is not based on the "
"SGML parser in :mod:`sgmllib`."

"An :class:`HTMLParser` instance is fed HTML data and calls handler functions "
"when tags begin and end.  The :class:`HTMLParser` class is meant to be "
"overridden by the user to provide a desired behavior."

#: ../../../library/htmlparser.rst:35

"Unlike the parser in :mod:`htmllib`, this parser does not check that end "
"tags match start tags or call the end-tag handler for elements which are "
"closed implicitly by closing an outer element."

"Exception raised by the :class:`HTMLParser` class when it encounters an "
"error while parsing.  This exception provides three attributes: :attr:`msg` "
"is a brief message explaining the error, :attr:`lineno` is the number of the "
"line on which the broken construct was detected, and :attr:`offset` is the "
"number of characters into the line at which the construct starts."

"Feed some text to the parser.  It is processed insofar as it consists of "
"complete elements; incomplete data is buffered until more data is fed or :"
"meth:`close` is called."

#: ../../../library/htmlparser.rst:68
msgid ""
"Force processing of all buffered data as if it were followed by an end-of-"
"file mark.  This method may be redefined by a derived class to define "
"additional processing at the end of the input, but the redefined version "
"should always call the :class:`HTMLParser` base class method :meth:`close`."

"Return the text of the most recently opened start tag.  This should not "

"The *tag* argument is the name of the tag converted to lower case. The "
"*attrs* argument is a list of ``(name, value)`` pairs containing the "
"attributes found inside the tag's ``<>`` brackets.  The *name* will be "
"translated to lower case, and quotes in the *value* have been removed, and "
"character and entity references have been replaced.  For instance, for the "

"Similar to :meth:`handle_starttag`, but called when the parser encounters an "
"XHTML-style empty tag (``<a .../>``).  This method may be overridden by "
