"This module contains functions to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a "
"fault, after a timeout, or on a user signal. Call :func:`faulthandler."
"enable` to install fault handlers for the :const:`SIGSEGV`, :const:"
"`SIGFPE`, :const:`SIGABRT`, :const:`SIGBUS`, and :const:`SIGILL` signals. "
"You can also enable them at startup by setting the :envvar:"
"`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER` environment variable or by using :option:`-X` "
"``faulthandler`` command line option."

"The fault handler is compatible with system fault handlers like Apport or "
"the Windows fault handler. The module uses an alternative stack for signal "
"handlers if the :c:func:`sigaltstack` function is available. This allows it "
"to dump the traceback even on a stack overflow."

"The fault handler is called on catastrophic cases and therefore can only use "
"signal-safe functions (e.g. it cannot allocate memory on the heap). Because "
"of this limitation traceback dumping is minimal compared to normal Python "
"tracebacks:"
