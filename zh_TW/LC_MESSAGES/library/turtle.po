"Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to kids.  It "

"Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the x-y plane.  Give it the "
"command ``turtle.forward(15)``, and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in the "
"direction it is facing, drawing a line as it moves.  Give it the command "
"``turtle.left(25)``, and it rotates in-place 25 degrees clockwise."

msgid ""
"It tries to keep the merits of the old turtle module and to be (nearly) 100% "
"compatible with it.  This means in the first place to enable the learning "

"The turtle module provides turtle graphics primitives, in both object-"

"used as part of some application."
msgstr ""
