"Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient "
"high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-"
"oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together "
"with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and "
"rapid application development in many areas on most platforms."

"Python 是一種易學、功能強大的程式語言。它有高效能的高階資料結構，也有簡單但有"
"效的方法去實現物件導向程式設計。Python 優雅的語法和動態型別，結合其直譯特性，"
"使它成為眾多領域和大多數平臺上，撰寫腳本和快速開發應用程式的理想語言。"

"The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely "
"available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python "

"The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types "
"implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also "
"suitable as an extension language for customizable applications."

"使用 C 或 C++（或其他可被 C 呼叫的程式語言），可以很容易在 Python 直譯器內新"
"增函式及資料型別。同時，對可讓使用者自訂功能的應用程式來說，Python 也適合作為"
"其擴充語言 （extension language）。"

"This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and "
"features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python "
"interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-"

"For a description of standard objects and modules, see :ref:`library-"
"index`. :ref:`reference-index` gives a more formal definition of the "
"language.  To write extensions in C or C++, read :ref:`extending-index` and :"
"ref:`c-api-index`. There are also several books covering Python in depth."

"This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single "
"feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of "
"Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the "
"language's flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and "
"write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about "
"the various Python library modules described in :ref:`library-index`."
