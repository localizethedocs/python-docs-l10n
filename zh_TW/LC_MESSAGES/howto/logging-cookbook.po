"One solution is to use a two-part approach. For the first part, attach only "

"The :meth:`process` method of :class:`LoggerAdapter` is where the contextual "

"default implementation of this method leaves the message alone, but inserts "
"an 'extra' key in the keyword argument whose value is the dict-like object "

"Logging calls (``logger.debug()``, ``logger.info()`` etc.) only take "
"positional parameters for the actual logging message itself, with keyword "

"\"$message\". It's a little unwieldy to use the class names whenever you "
