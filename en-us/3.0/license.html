<h2>History of the software<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-the-software" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cwi.nl/">http://www.cwi.nl/</a>) in the Netherlands as a
successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python’s principal author,
although it includes many contributions from others.</p>
<p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/">http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/</a>) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.</p>
<p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to
form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs
team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.zope.com/">http://www.zope.com/</a>).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/">http://www.python.org/psf/</a>) was formed, a non-profit organization created
specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a
sponsoring member of the PSF.</p>
<p>All Python releases are Open Source (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</a> for the Open
Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also
been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.</p>
