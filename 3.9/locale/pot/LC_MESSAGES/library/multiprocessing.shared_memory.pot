"This module provides a class, :class:`SharedMemory`, for the allocation and "
"management of shared memory to be accessed by one or more processes on a "
"multicore or symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) machine.  To assist with the "
"life-cycle management of shared memory especially across distinct processes, "
"a :class:`~multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager` subclass, :class:"
"`SharedMemoryManager`, is also provided in the ``multiprocessing.managers`` "
"module."

"In this module, shared memory refers to \"System V style\" shared memory "
"blocks (though is not necessarily implemented explicitly as such) and does "
"not refer to \"distributed shared memory\".  This style of shared memory "
"permits distinct processes to potentially read and write to a common (or "
"shared) region of volatile memory.  Processes are conventionally limited to "
"only have access to their own process memory space but shared memory permits "
"the sharing of data between processes, avoiding the need to instead send "
"messages between processes containing that data.  Sharing data directly via "
"memory can provide significant performance benefits compared to sharing data "
"via disk or socket or other communications requiring the serialization/"
"deserialization and copying of data."

"Creates a new shared memory block or attaches to an existing shared memory "
"block.  Each shared memory block is assigned a unique name. In this way, one "
"process can create a shared memory block with a particular name and a "
"different process can attach to that same shared memory block using that "
"same name."

"As a resource for sharing data across processes, shared memory blocks may "
"outlive the original process that created them.  When one process no longer "
"needs access to a shared memory block that might still be needed by other "
"processes, the :meth:`close()` method should be called. When a shared memory "
"block is no longer needed by any process, the :meth:`unlink()` method should "
"be called to ensure proper cleanup."

"*name* is the unique name for the requested shared memory, specified as a "
"string.  When creating a new shared memory block, if ``None`` (the default) "
"is supplied for the name, a novel name will be generated."

"an existing shared memory block is attached (``False``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/multiprocessing.shared_memory.rst:61
msgid ""
"*size* specifies the requested number of bytes when creating a new shared "
"memory block.  Because some platforms choose to allocate chunks of memory "
"based upon that platform's memory page size, the exact size of the shared "
"memory block may be larger or equal to the size requested.  When attaching "
"to an existing shared memory block, the ``size`` parameter is ignored."

"Closes access to the shared memory from this instance.  In order to ensure "
"proper cleanup of resources, all instances should call ``close()`` once the "
"instance is no longer needed.  Note that calling ``close()`` does not cause "
"the shared memory block itself to be destroyed."

"Requests that the underlying shared memory block be destroyed.  In order to "
"ensure proper cleanup of resources, ``unlink()`` should be called once (and "
"only once) across all processes which have need for the shared memory "
"block.  After requesting its destruction, a shared memory block may or may "
"not be immediately destroyed and this behavior may differ across platforms.  "
"Attempts to access data inside the shared memory block after ``unlink()`` "
"has been called may result in memory access errors.  Note: the last process "
"relinquishing its hold on a shared memory block may call ``unlink()`` and :"
"meth:`close()` in either order."
