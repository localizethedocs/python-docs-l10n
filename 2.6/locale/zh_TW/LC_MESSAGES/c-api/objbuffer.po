"This section describes the legacy buffer protocol, which has been introduced "
"in Python 1.6. It is still supported but deprecated in the Python 2.x "
"series. Python 3.0 introduces a new buffer protocol which fixes weaknesses "
"and shortcomings of the protocol, and has been backported to Python 2.6.  "
