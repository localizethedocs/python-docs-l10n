"The functions in this chapter will let you execute Python source code given "
"in a file or a buffer, but they will not let you interact in a more detailed "
"way with the interpreter."

"Several of these functions accept a start symbol from the grammar as a "
"parameter.  The available start symbols are :const:`Py_eval_input`, :const:"
"`Py_file_input`, and :const:`Py_single_input`.  These are described "
"following the functions which accept them as parameters."

"Note also that several of these functions take :ctype:`FILE\\*` parameters.  "
"One particular issue which needs to be handled carefully is that the :ctype:"
"`FILE` structure for different C libraries can be different and "
"incompatible.  Under Windows (at least), it is possible for dynamically "
"linked extensions to actually use different libraries, so care should be "
"taken that :ctype:`FILE\\*` parameters are only passed to these functions if "
"it is certain that they were created by the same library that the Python "
"runtime is using."
