"``from module import *`` is *invalid* inside function definitions. While "
"many versions of Python do not check for the invalidity, it does not make it "
"more valid, no more than having a smart lawyer makes a man innocent. Do not "
"use it like that ever. Even in versions where it was accepted, it made the "
"function execution slower, because the compiler could not be certain which "
"names are local and which are global. In Python 2.1 this construct causes "
"warnings, and sometimes even errors."

msgid ""
"While it is valid to use ``from module import *`` at module level it is "
"usually a bad idea. For one, this loses an important property Python "
"otherwise has --- you can know where each toplevel name is defined by a "
"simple \"search\" function in your favourite editor. You also open yourself "
"to trouble in the future, if some module grows additional functions or "
"classes."

"does not work. Of course, it works just fine (assuming you have a file "
"called \"www\".) But it does not work if somewhere in the module, the "
"statement ``from os import *`` is present. The :mod:`os` module has a "
"function called :func:`open` which returns an integer. While it is very "

"The word \"unadorned\" refers to the use without an explicit dictionary, in "

"This is a \"don't\" which is much weaker than the previous \"don't\"s but is "

"The reason it is usually bad idea is because you suddenly have an object "
"which lives in two separate namespaces. When the binding in one namespace "
"changes, the binding in the other will not, so there will be a discrepancy "
"between them. This happens when, for example, one module is reloaded, or "

"existing and non-existing files make it seem bugless, that means in testing "
