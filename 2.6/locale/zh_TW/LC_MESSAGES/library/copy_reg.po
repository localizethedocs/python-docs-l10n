"The :mod:`copy_reg` module has been renamed to :mod:`copyreg` in Python 3.0. "
"The :term:`2to3` tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your "
"sources to 3.0."

"The :mod:`copy_reg` module provides support for the :mod:`pickle` and :mod:"
"`cPickle` modules.  The :mod:`copy` module is likely to use this in the "
"future as well.  It provides configuration information about object "
"constructors which are not classes.  Such constructors may be factory "
"functions or class instances."

"Declares *object* to be a valid constructor.  If *object* is not callable "
"(and hence not valid as a constructor), raises :exc:`TypeError`."

msgid ""
"Declares that *function* should be used as a \"reduction\" function for "
"objects of type *type*; *type* must not be a \"classic\" class object.  "
"(Classic classes are handled differently; see the documentation for the :mod:"
"`pickle` module for details.)  *function* should return either a string or a "
"tuple containing two or three elements."

#: ../../../library/copy_reg.rst:38
msgid ""
"The optional *constructor* parameter, if provided, is a callable object "
"which can be used to reconstruct the object when called with the tuple of "
"arguments returned by *function* at pickling time.  :exc:`TypeError` will be "
"raised if *object* is a class or *constructor* is not callable."
