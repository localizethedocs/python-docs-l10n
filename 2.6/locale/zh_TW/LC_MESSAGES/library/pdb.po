msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pdb.rst:13
msgid ""
"The module :mod:`pdb` defines an interactive source code debugger for Python "
"programs.  It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single stepping "
"at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source code listing, "
"and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame.  "
"It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be called under program "
"control."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pdb.rst:24
msgid ""
"The debugger is extensible --- it is actually defined as the class :class:"
"`Pdb`. This is currently undocumented but easily understood by reading the "
"source.  The extension interface uses the modules :mod:`bdb` and :mod:`cmd`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pdb.rst:28

"The debugger's prompt is ``(Pdb)``. Typical usage to run a program under "

"When invoked as a script, pdb will automatically enter post-mortem debugging "
"if the program being debugged exits abnormally. After post-mortem debugging "

"The debugger recognizes the following commands.  Most commands can be "

"or ``help`` can be used to enter the help command (but not ``he`` or "
"``hel``, nor ``H`` or ``Help`` or ``HELP``).  Arguments to commands must be "
"separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs).  Optional arguments are enclosed "

"Commands that the debugger doesn't recognize are assumed to be Python "
"statements and are executed in the context of the program being debugged.  "
"Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation point (``!``).  "
"This is a powerful way to inspect the program being debugged; it is even "
"possible to change a variable or call a function.  When an exception occurs "
"in such a statement, the exception name is printed but the debugger's state "
"is not changed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by ``;;``.  (A "
"single ``;`` is not used as it is the separator for multiple commands in a "
