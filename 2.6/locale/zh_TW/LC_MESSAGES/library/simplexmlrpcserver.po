"Create a new server instance.  This class provides methods for registration "
"of functions that can be called by the XML-RPC protocol.  The "
"*requestHandler* parameter should be a factory for request handler "
"instances; it defaults to :class:`SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler`.  The *addr* "
"and *requestHandler* parameters are passed to the :class:`SocketServer."
"TCPServer` constructor.  If *logRequests* is true (the default), requests "
"will be logged; setting this parameter to false will turn off logging.   The "
"*allow_none* and *encoding* parameters are passed on to  :mod:`xmlrpclib` "
"and control the XML-RPC responses that will be returned from the server. The "
"*bind_and_activate* parameter controls whether :meth:`server_bind` and :meth:"
"`server_activate` are called immediately by the constructor; it defaults to "
"true. Setting it to false allows code to manipulate the "
"*allow_reuse_address* class variable before the address is bound."
