"In 1968, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, better "
"known by its acronym ASCII, was standardized.  ASCII defined numeric codes "
"for various characters, with the numeric values running from 0 to 127.  For "
"example, the lowercase letter 'a' is assigned 97 as its code value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../howto/unicode.rst:22
msgid ""
"ASCII was an American-developed standard, so it only defined unaccented "
"characters.  There was an 'e', but no 'é' or 'Í'.  This meant that languages "
"which required accented characters couldn't be faithfully represented in "
"ASCII. (Actually the missing accents matter for English, too, which contains "
"words such as 'naïve' and 'café', and some publications have house styles "
"which require spellings such as 'coöperate'.)"

"In the 1980s, almost all personal computers were 8-bit, meaning that bytes "
"could hold values ranging from 0 to 255.  ASCII codes only went up to 127, "
"so some machines assigned values between 128 and 255 to accented "
"characters.  Different machines had different codes, however, which led to "
"problems exchanging files. Eventually various commonly used sets of values "
"for the 128-255 range emerged. Some were true standards, defined by the "
"International Standards Organization, and some were **de facto** conventions "
"that were invented by one company or another and managed to catch on."

"every single human language. It turns out that even 16 bits isn't enough to "

"A **character** is the smallest possible component of a text.  'A', 'B', "
"'C', etc., are all different characters.  So are 'È' and 'Í'.  Characters "
"are abstractions, and vary depending on the language or context you're "
"talking about.  For example, the symbol for ohms (Ω) is usually drawn much "
"like the capital letter omega (Ω) in the Greek alphabet (they may even be "
"the same in some fonts), but these are two different characters that have "
"different meanings."

"The Unicode standard describes how characters are represented by **code "

"If you attempt to write processing functions that accept both Unicode and 8-"
"bit strings, you will find your program vulnerable to bugs wherever you "

#: ../../../howto/unicode.rst:643

"When using data coming from a web browser or some other untrusted source, a "
"common technique is to check for illegal characters in a string before using "
"the string in a generated command line or storing it in a database.  If "
"you're doing this, be careful to check the string once it's in the form that "
"will be used or stored; it's possible for encodings to be used to disguise "
"characters.  This is especially true if the input data also specifies the "
"encoding; many encodings leave the commonly checked-for characters alone, "

"single character."
