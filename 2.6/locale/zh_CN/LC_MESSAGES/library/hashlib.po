"This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and "
"message digest algorithms.  Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms "
"SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 (defined in FIPS 180-2) as well as "
"RSA's MD5 algorithm (defined in Internet :rfc:`1321`). The terms secure hash "
"and message digest are interchangeable.  Older algorithms were called "
"message digests.  The modern term is secure hash."

"`sha1` to create a SHA1 hash object. You can now feed this object with "
"arbitrary strings using the :meth:`update` method.  At any point you can ask "
"it for the :dfn:`digest` of the concatenation of the strings fed to it so "
