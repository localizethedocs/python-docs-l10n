"The :mod:`commands` module contains wrapper functions for :func:`os.popen` "
"which take a system command as a string and return any output generated by "
"the command and, optionally, the exit status."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/commands.rst:15
msgid ""
"The :mod:`subprocess` module provides more powerful facilities for spawning "
"new processes and retrieving their results.  Using the :mod:`subprocess` "
"module is preferable to using the :mod:`commands` module."

"In Python 3.x, :func:`getstatus` and two undocumented functions (:func:"
"`mk2arg` and :func:`mkarg`) have been removed.  Also, :func:"
"`getstatusoutput` and :func:`getoutput` have been moved to the :mod:"
"`subprocess` module."

msgid "The :mod:`commands` module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/commands.rst:31
msgid ""
"Execute the string *cmd* in a shell with :func:`os.popen` and return a 2-"
"tuple ``(status, output)``.  *cmd* is actually run as ``{ cmd ; } 2>&1``, so "
"that the returned output will contain output or error messages. A trailing "
"newline is stripped from the output. The exit status for the command can be "
"interpreted according to the rules for the C function :cfunc:`wait`."

#: ../../../library/commands.rst:40
msgid ""
"Like :func:`getstatusoutput`, except the exit status is ignored and the "
"return value is a string containing the command's output."

#: ../../../library/commands.rst:46

"Return the output of ``ls -ld file`` as a string.  This function uses the :"
"func:`getoutput` function, and properly escapes backslashes and dollar signs "
"in the argument."

"This function is nonobvious and useless.  The name is also misleading in the "
"presence of :func:`getstatusoutput`."
