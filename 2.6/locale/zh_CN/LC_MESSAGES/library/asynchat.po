msgid ""
"This module builds on the :mod:`asyncore` infrastructure, simplifying "
"asynchronous clients and servers and making it easier to handle protocols "
"whose elements are terminated by arbitrary strings, or are of variable "
"length. :mod:`asynchat` defines the abstract class :class:`async_chat` that "
"you subclass, providing implementations of the :meth:`collect_incoming_data` "
"and :meth:`found_terminator` methods. It uses the same asynchronous loop as :"
"mod:`asyncore`, and the two types of channel, :class:`asyncore.dispatcher` "
"and :class:`asynchat.async_chat`, can freely be mixed in the channel map. "
"Typically an :class:`asyncore.dispatcher` server channel generates new :"
"class:`asynchat.async_chat` channel objects as it receives incoming "
"connection requests."

"This class is an abstract subclass of :class:`asyncore.dispatcher`. To make "
"practical use of the code you must subclass :class:`async_chat`, providing "
"meaningful :meth:`collect_incoming_data` and :meth:`found_terminator` "
"methods. The :class:`asyncore.dispatcher` methods can be used, although not "
"all make sense in a message/response context."

"Like :class:`asyncore.dispatcher`, :class:`async_chat` defines a set of "
"events that are generated by an analysis of socket conditions after a :cfunc:"
"`select` call. Once the polling loop has been started the :class:"
"`async_chat` object's methods are called by the event-processing framework "
"with no action on the part of the programmer."

"Unlike :class:`asyncore.dispatcher`, :class:`async_chat` allows you to "
"define a first-in-first-out queue (fifo) of *producers*. A producer need "
"have only one method, :meth:`more`, which should return data to be "
"transmitted on the channel. The producer indicates exhaustion (*i.e.* that "
"it contains no more data) by having its :meth:`more` method return the empty "
"string. At this point the :class:`async_chat` object removes the producer "
"from the fifo and starts using the next producer, if any. When the producer "
"fifo is empty the :meth:`handle_write` method does nothing. You use the "
"channel object's :meth:`set_terminator` method to describe how to recognize "
"the end of, or an important breakpoint in, an incoming transmission from the "
"remote endpoint."
