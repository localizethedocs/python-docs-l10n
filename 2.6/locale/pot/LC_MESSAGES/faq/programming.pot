#: ../../../faq/programming.rst:152
msgid ""
"One thing to notice is that function and (especially) method calls are "
"rather expensive; if you have designed a purely OO interface with lots of "
"tiny functions that don't do much more than get or set an instance variable "
"or call another method, you might consider using a more direct way such as "
"directly accessing instance variables.  Also see the standard module :mod:"
"`profile` which makes it possible to find out where your program is spending "
"most of its time (if you have some patience -- the profiling itself can slow "
"your program down by an order of magnitude)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../faq/programming.rst:161
msgid ""
"Remember that many standard optimization heuristics you may know from other "
"programming experience may well apply to Python.  For example it may be "
"faster to send output to output devices using larger writes rather than "
"smaller ones in order to reduce the overhead of kernel system calls.  Thus "
"CGI scripts that write all output in \"one shot\" may be faster than those "
"that write lots of small pieces of output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../faq/programming.rst:168
msgid ""
"Also, be sure to use Python's core features where appropriate.  For example, "
"slicing allows programs to chop up lists and other sequence objects in a "
"single tick of the interpreter's mainloop using highly optimized C "
"implementations. Thus to get the same effect as::"

"Note that the functionally-oriented built-in functions such as :func:`map`, :"

"the more obvious ``s1+s2+s3+s4+s5+s6+s7``, since the \"summation\" will "
"compute many subexpressions, whereas ``join()`` does all the copying in one "
"pass.  For manipulating strings, use the ``replace()`` and the ``format()`` :"
"ref:`methods on string objects <string-methods>`.  Use regular expressions "
"only when you're not dealing with constant string patterns.  You may still "

"Another common trick is to \"push loops into functions or methods.\"  For "
"example suppose you have a program that runs slowly and you use the profiler "
"to determine that a Python function ``ff()`` is being called lots of times.  "
"If you notice that ``ff()``::"

"then you can often eliminate function call overhead by rewriting ``ff()`` "

#: ../../../faq/programming.rst:311
msgid ""
"This is because when you make an assignment to a variable in a scope, that "

"uninitialized local variable and an error results."

"In the example above you can access the outer scope variable by declaring it "

msgid "What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?"

#: ../../../faq/programming.rst:340
msgid ""
"In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are "
"implicitly global.  If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within "
"the function's body, it's assumed to be a local.  If a variable is ever "
"assigned a new value inside the function, the variable is implicitly local, "
"and you need to explicitly declare it as 'global'."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../faq/programming.rst:346
msgid ""
"Though a bit surprising at first, a moment's consideration explains this.  "
"On one hand, requiring :keyword:`global` for assigned variables provides a "
"bar against unintended side-effects.  On the other hand, if ``global`` was "
"required for all global references, you'd be using ``global`` all the time.  "
"You'd have to declare as global every reference to a built-in function or to "
"a component of an imported module.  This clutter would defeat the usefulness "

msgid "How do I share global variables across modules?"

#: ../../../faq/programming.rst:358
msgid ""
"The canonical way to share information across modules within a single "
"program is to create a special module (often called config or cfg).  Just "
"import the config module in all modules of your application; the module then "
"becomes available as a global name.  Because there is only one instance of "
