"There can be zero or more :keyword:`elif` parts, and the :keyword:`else` "

"The :keyword:`for` statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be "

"progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to "
"define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python's :"
"keyword:`for` statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a "
"string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.  For example (no pun "
"intended):"

"It is not safe to modify the sequence being iterated over in the loop (this "

"The *execution* of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the "

"In general, an argument list must have any positional arguments followed by "

"When a final formal parameter of the form ``**name`` is present, it receives "
"a dictionary (see :ref:`typesmapping`) containing all keyword arguments "
"except for those corresponding to a formal parameter.  This may be combined "
"with a formal parameter of the form ``*name`` (described in the next "
"subsection) which receives a tuple containing the positional arguments "
"beyond the formal parameter list.  (``*name`` must occur before ``**name``.) "
