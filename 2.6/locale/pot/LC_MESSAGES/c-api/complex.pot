"Python's complex number objects are implemented as two distinct types when "
"viewed from the C API:  one is the Python object exposed to Python programs, "
"and the other is a C structure which represents the actual complex number "
"value. The API provides functions for working with both."

"Note that the functions which accept these structures as parameters and "
"return them as results do so *by value* rather than dereferencing them "
"through pointers.  This is consistent throughout the API."
