"While ``abs(x%y) < abs(y)`` is true mathematically, for floats it may not be "
"true numerically due to roundoff.  For example, and assuming a platform on "
"which a Python float is an IEEE 754 double-precision number, in order that "
"``-1e-100 % 1e100`` have the same sign as ``1e100``, the computed result is "
"``-1e-100 + 1e100``, which is numerically exactly equal to ``1e100``.  "
"Function :func:`fmod` in the :mod:`math` module returns a result whose sign "
"matches the sign of the first argument instead, and so returns ``-1e-100`` "
"in this case. Which approach is more appropriate depends on the application."
