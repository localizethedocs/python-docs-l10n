msgid ""
"Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to "
"alert the user of some condition in a program, where that condition "
"(normally) doesn't warrant raising an exception and terminating the "
"program.  For example, one might want to issue a warning when a program uses "
"an obsolete module."

"Python programmers issue warnings by calling the :func:`warn` function "

"Warning messages are normally written to ``sys.stderr``, but their "
"disposition can be changed flexibly, from ignoring all warnings to turning "
"them into exceptions.  The disposition of warnings can vary based on the "
"warning category (see below), the text of the warning message, and the "
"source location where it is issued.  Repetitions of a particular warning for "
"the same source location are typically suppressed."

"There are two stages in warning control: first, each time a warning is "
