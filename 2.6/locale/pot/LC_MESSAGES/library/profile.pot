msgid ""
":dfn:`Deterministic profiling` is meant to reflect the fact that all "
"*function call*, *function return*, and *exception* events are monitored, "
"and precise timings are made for the intervals between these events (during "
"which time the user's code is executing).  In contrast, :dfn:`statistical "
"profiling` (which is not done by this module) randomly samples the effective "
"instruction pointer, and deduces where time is being spent.  The latter "
"technique traditionally involves less overhead (as the code does not need to "
"be instrumented), but provides only relative indications of where time is "
"being spent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/profile.rst:196
msgid ""
"In Python, since there is an interpreter active during execution, the "
"presence of instrumented code is not required to do deterministic "
"profiling.  Python automatically provides a :dfn:`hook` (optional callback) "
"for each event.  In addition, the interpreted nature of Python tends to add "
"so much overhead to execution, that deterministic profiling tends to only "
"add small processing overhead in typical applications.  The result is that "
"deterministic profiling is not that expensive, yet provides extensive run "
"time statistics about the execution of a Python program."

"Call count statistics can be used to identify bugs in code (surprising "
"counts), and to identify possible inline-expansion points (high call "
"counts).  Internal time statistics can be used to identify \"hot loops\" "
"that should be carefully optimized.  Cumulative time statistics should be "
"used to identify high level errors in the selection of algorithms.  Note "
"that the unusual handling of cumulative times in this profiler allows "
"statistics for recursive implementations of algorithms to be directly "

"The :class:`Profile` class of both modules, :mod:`profile` and :mod:"
"`cProfile`, were written so that derived classes could be developed to "
"extend the profiler. The details are not described here, as doing this "
"successfully requires an expert understanding of how the :class:`Profile` "
"class works internally.  Study the source code of the module carefully if "
"you want to pursue this."

":func:`your_time_func` should return a single number, or a list of numbers "
"whose sum is the current time (like what :func:`os.times` returns).  If the "
"function returns a single time number, or the list of returned numbers has "

"Be warned that you should calibrate the profiler class for the timer "

"integer value will provide the best results in terms of low overhead during "
"profiling. (:func:`os.times` is *pretty* bad, as it returns a tuple of "
"floating point values).  If you want to substitute a better timer in the "
"cleanest fashion, derive a class and hardwire a replacement dispatch method "
"that best handles your timer call, along with the appropriate calibration "
"constant."
