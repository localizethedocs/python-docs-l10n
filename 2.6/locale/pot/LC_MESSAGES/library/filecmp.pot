"The :mod:`filecmp` module defines functions to compare files and "
"directories, with various optional time/correctness trade-offs. For "
"comparing files, see also the :mod:`difflib` module."

msgid "The :mod:`filecmp` module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/filecmp.rst:19

"Compare the files named *f1* and *f2*, returning ``True`` if they seem "
"equal, ``False`` otherwise."

"unless their :func:`os.stat` signature changes."

"Returns three lists of file names: *match*, *mismatch*, *errors*.  *match* "
"contains the list of files that match, *mismatch* contains the names of "
"those that don't, and *errors* lists the names of files which could not be "
"compared.  Files are listed in *errors* if they don't exist in one of the "
"directories, the user lacks permission to read them or if the comparison "
"could not be done for some other reason."

"For example, ``cmpfiles('a', 'b', ['c', 'd/e'])`` will compare ``a/c`` with "
"``b/c`` and ``a/d/e`` with ``b/d/e``.  ``'c'`` and ``'d/e'`` will each be in "
