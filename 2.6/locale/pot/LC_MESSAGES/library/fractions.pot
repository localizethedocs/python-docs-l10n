"of :class:`numbers.Integral` and returns a new :class:`Fraction` instance "

"raises a :exc:`ZeroDivisionError`. The second version requires that "
"*other_fraction* is an instance of :class:`numbers.Rational` and returns an :"

"constructor expects a string or unicode instance in one of two possible "
