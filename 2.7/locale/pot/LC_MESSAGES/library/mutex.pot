"A mutex has two pieces of state --- a \"locked\" bit and a queue. When the "
"mutex is not locked, the queue is empty. Otherwise, the queue contains zero "
"or more ``(function, argument)`` pairs representing functions (or methods) "
"waiting to acquire the lock. When the mutex is unlocked while the queue is "
"not empty, the first queue entry is removed and its  ``function(argument)`` "
"pair called, implying it now has the lock."
