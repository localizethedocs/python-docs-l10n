"`~Shelf.close`; this can make it handier to mutate mutable entries in the "
"persistent dictionary, but, if many entries are accessed, it can consume "
"vast amounts of memory for the cache, and it can make the close operation "

"The choice of which database package will be used (such as :mod:`dbm`, :mod:"

"is also (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of :mod:`dbm`, if it is "
