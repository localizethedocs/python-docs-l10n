"The modules described in this chapter provide numeric and math-related "
"functions and data types. The :mod:`numbers` module defines an abstract "
"hierarchy of numeric types. The :mod:`math` and :mod:`cmath` modules contain "
"various mathematical functions for floating-point and complex numbers. For "
"users more interested in decimal accuracy than in speed, the :mod:`decimal` "
"module supports exact representations of decimal numbers."
