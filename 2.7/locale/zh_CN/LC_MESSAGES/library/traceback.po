"This module provides a standard interface to extract, format and print stack "
"traces of Python programs.  It exactly mimics the behavior of the Python "
"interpreter when it prints a stack trace.  This is useful when you want to "
"print stack traces under program control, such as in a \"wrapper\" around "
"the interpreter."
