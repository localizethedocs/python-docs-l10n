"This module implements an interface to the :manpage:`crypt(3)` routine, "
"which is a one-way hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm; see "
"the Unix man page for further details.  Possible uses include allowing "
"Python scripts to accept typed passwords from the user, or attempting to "
"crack Unix passwords with a dictionary."

"Notice that the behavior of this module depends on the actual "
"implementation  of the :manpage:`crypt(3)` routine in the running system.  "
"Therefore, any extensions available on the current implementation will also  "
"be available on this module."

"*word* will usually be a user's password as typed at a prompt or  in a "
"graphical interface.  *salt* is usually a random two-character string which "
"will be used to perturb the DES algorithm in one of 4096 ways.  The "
"characters in *salt* must be in the set ``[./a-zA-Z0-9]``.  Returns the "
"hashed password as a string, which will be composed of characters from the "
"same alphabet as the salt (the first two characters represent the salt "
"itself)."

"Since a few :manpage:`crypt(3)` extensions allow different values, with "
"different sizes in the *salt*, it is recommended to use  the full crypted "
"password as salt when checking for a password."
