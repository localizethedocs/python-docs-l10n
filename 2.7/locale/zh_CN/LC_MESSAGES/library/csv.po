"The so-called CSV (Comma Separated Values) format is the most common import "
"and export format for spreadsheets and databases.  There is no \"CSV "
"standard\", so the format is operationally defined by the many applications "
"which read and write it.  The lack of a standard means that subtle "
"differences often exist in the data produced and consumed by different "
"applications.  These differences can make it annoying to process CSV files "
"from multiple sources.  Still, while the delimiters and quoting characters "
"vary, the overall format is similar enough that it is possible to write a "
"single module which can efficiently manipulate such data, hiding the details "
"of reading and writing the data from the programmer."
