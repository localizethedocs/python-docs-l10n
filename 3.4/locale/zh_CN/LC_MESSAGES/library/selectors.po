"It defines a :class:`BaseSelector` abstract base class, along with several "
"concrete implementations (:class:`KqueueSelector`, :class:"
"`EpollSelector`...), that can be used to wait for I/O readiness notification "
"on multiple file objects. In the following, \"file object\" refers to any "
"object with a :meth:`fileno()` method, or a raw file descriptor. See :term:"
"`file object`."
