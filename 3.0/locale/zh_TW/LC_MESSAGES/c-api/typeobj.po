"Perhaps one of the most important structures of the Python object system is "
"the structure that defines a new type: the :ctype:`PyTypeObject` structure.  "
"Type objects can be handled using any of the :cfunc:`PyObject_\\*` or :cfunc:"
"`PyType_\\*` functions, but do not offer much that's interesting to most "
"Python applications. These objects are fundamental to how objects behave, so "
"they are very important to the interpreter itself and to any extension "
"module that implements new types."

"Type objects are fairly large compared to most of the standard types. The "
"reason for the size is that each type object stores a large number of "
"values, mostly C function pointers, each of which implements a small part of "
"the type's functionality.  The fields of the type object are examined in "
"detail in this section.  The fields will be described in the order in which "
"they occur in the structure."

"The type object structure extends the :ctype:`PyVarObject` structure. The :"
"attr:`ob_size` field is used for dynamic types (created by  :func:"
"`type_new`, usually called from a class statement). Note that :cdata:"

"Also, note that, in a garbage collected Python, tp_dealloc may be called "
"from any Python thread, not just the thread which created the object (if the "
"object becomes part of a refcount cycle, that cycle might be collected by a "
"garbage collection on any thread).  This is not a problem for Python API "
"calls, since the thread on which tp_dealloc is called will own the Global "
"Interpreter Lock (GIL). However, if the object being destroyed in turn "
"destroys objects from some other C or C++ library, care should be taken to "
"ensure that destroying those objects on the thread which called tp_dealloc "
"will not violate any assumptions of the library."
