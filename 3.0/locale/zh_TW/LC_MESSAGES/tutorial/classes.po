"Python's class mechanism adds classes to the language with a minimum of new "
"syntax and semantics.  It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ "
"and Modula-3.  As is true for modules, classes in Python do not put an "
"absolute barrier between definition and user, but rather rely on the "
"politeness of the user not to \"break into the definition.\"  The most "
"important features of classes are retained with full power, however: the "
"class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class "
"can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call "
"the method of a base class with the same name.  Objects can contain an "
"arbitrary amount of private data."

"In C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are "

"*virtual*.  There are no special constructors or destructors.  As in "
"Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the object's members from "
"its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument "
"representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call.  As in "
"Smalltalk, classes themselves are objects, albeit in the wider sense of the "
"word: in Python, all data types are objects.  This provides semantics for "
"importing and renaming.  Unlike  C++ and Modula-3, built-in types can be "
"used as base classes for extension by the user.  Also, like in C++ but "
"unlike in Modula-3, most built-in operators with special syntax (arithmetic "
"operators, subscripting etc.) can be redefined for class instances."

"Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be "

"This is usually not appreciated on a first glance at Python, and can be "
"safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, "
"tuples).  However, aliasing has an (intended!) effect on the semantics of "
"Python code involving mutable objects such as lists, dictionaries, and most "
"types representing entities outside the program (files, windows, etc.).  "
"This is usually used to the benefit of the program, since aliases behave "
"like pointers in some respects. For example, passing an object is cheap "
"since only a pointer is passed by the implementation; and if a function "
"modifies an object passed as an argument, the caller will see the change --- "
"this eliminates the need for two different argument passing mechanisms as in "
"Pascal."

"A *namespace* is a mapping from names to objects.  Most namespaces are "

"such as :func:`abs`, and built-in exception names); the global names in a "
"module; and the local names in a function invocation.  In a sense the set of "
"attributes of an object also form a namespace.  The important thing to know "

"Dynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance "
"exhibit one or more diamond relationships (where at least one of the parent "
"classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class).  "
"For example, all classes inherit from :class:`object`, so any case of "
"multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach :class:`object`.  "
"To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic "
"algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-"
"right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, "
"and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without "
"affecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these "
"properties make it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with "
"multiple inheritance.  For more detail, see http://www.python.org/download/"
