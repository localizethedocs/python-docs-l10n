"Open a bz2 file. Mode can be either ``'r'`` or ``'w'``, for reading "
"(default) or writing. When opened for writing, the file will be created if "
"it doesn't exist, and truncated otherwise. If *buffering* is given, ``0`` "
"means unbuffered, and larger numbers specify the buffer size; the default is "
"``0``. If *compresslevel* is given, it must be a number between ``1`` and "
"``9``; the default is ``9``. Add a ``'U'`` to mode to open the file for "
"input with universal newline support. Any line ending in the input file will "
"be seen as a ``'\\n'`` in Python.  Also, a file so opened gains the "
"attribute :attr:`newlines`; the value for this attribute is one of ``None`` "
"(no newline read yet), ``'\\r'``, ``'\\n'``, ``'\\r\\n'`` or a tuple "
