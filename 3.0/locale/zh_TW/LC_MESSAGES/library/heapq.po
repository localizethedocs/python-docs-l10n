"Heaps are arrays for which ``heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1]`` and ``heap[k] <= "
"heap[2*k+2]`` for all *k*, counting elements from zero.  For the sake of "
"comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The "
"interesting property of a heap is that ``heap[0]`` is always its smallest "
"element."

"The API below differs from textbook heap algorithms in two aspects: (a) We "
"use zero-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the index for "
"a node and the indexes for its children slightly less obvious, but is more "
"suitable since Python uses zero-based indexing. (b) Our pop method returns "
"the smallest item, not the largest (called a \"min heap\" in textbooks; a "
"\"max heap\" is more common in texts because of its suitability for in-place "
"sorting)."

#: ../../../library/heapq.rst:26

"These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list without "

"In the tree above, each cell *k* is topping ``2*k+1`` and ``2*k+2``. In an "
"usual binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner over the "
"two cells it tops, and we can trace the winner down the tree to see all "
"opponents s/he had.  However, in many computer applications of such "
"tournaments, we do not need to trace the history of a winner. To be more "
"memory efficient, when a winner is promoted, we try to replace it by "
"something else at a lower level, and the rule becomes that a cell and the "
"two cells it tops contain three different items, but the top cell \"wins\" "
"over the two topped cells."

"If this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is clearly the "
"overall winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and find the "
"\"next\" winner is to move some loser (let's say cell 30 in the diagram "
"above) into the 0 position, and then percolate this new 0 down the tree, "
"exchanging values, until the invariant is re-established. This is clearly "
"logarithmic on the total number of items in the tree. By iterating over all "
"items, you get an O(n log n) sort."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/heapq.rst:181
msgid ""
"A nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert new items "
"while the sort is going on, provided that the inserted items are not "
"\"better\" than the last 0'th element you extracted.  This is especially "
"useful in simulation contexts, where the tree holds all incoming events, and "
"the \"win\" condition means the smallest scheduled time.  When an event "
"schedule other events for execution, they are scheduled into the future, so "
"they can easily go into the heap.  So, a heap is a good structure for "
"implementing schedulers (this is what I used for my MIDI sequencer :-)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/heapq.rst:190
msgid ""
"Various structures for implementing schedulers have been extensively "
"studied, and heaps are good for this, as they are reasonably speedy, the "
"speed is almost constant, and the worst case is not much different than the "
"average case. However, there are other representations which are more "
"efficient overall, yet the worst cases might be terrible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/heapq.rst:196
msgid ""
"Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all know "
"that a big sort implies producing \"runs\" (which are pre-sorted sequences, "
"which size is usually related to the amount of CPU memory), followed by a "
"merging passes for these runs, which merging is often very cleverly "
"organised [#]_. It is very important that the initial sort produces the "
"longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way to that.  If, using all "
"the memory available to hold a tournament, you replace and percolate items "
"that happen to fit the current run, you'll produce runs which are twice the "
"size of the memory for random input, and much better for input fuzzily "
"ordered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/heapq.rst:206
msgid ""
"Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which may not "
"fit in the current tournament (because the value \"wins\" over the last "
"output value), it cannot fit in the heap, so the size of the heap "
"decreases.  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately for "
"progressively building a second heap, which grows at exactly the same rate "
"the first heap is melting.  When the first heap completely vanishes, you "
"switch heaps and start a new run.  Clever and quite effective!"

"In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in a few "
"applications, and I think it is good to keep a 'heap' module around. :-)"

"The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are more annoying "
"than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking capabilities of the "
"disks. On devices which cannot seek, like big tape drives, the story was "
"quite different, and one had to be very clever to ensure (far in advance) "
"that each tape movement will be the most effective possible (that is, will "
"best participate at \"progressing\" the merge).  Some tapes were even able "
"to read backwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time. "
"Believe me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch! From all "
"times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)"
