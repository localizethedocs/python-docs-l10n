"The :mod:`py_compile` module provides a function to generate a byte-code "
"file from a source file, and another function used when the module source "
"file is invoked as a script."

"Though not often needed, this function can be useful when installing modules "
"for shared use, especially if some of the users may not have permission to "
"write the byte-code cache files in the directory containing the source code."

"Compile a source file to byte-code and write out the byte-code cache  file.  "
"The source code is loaded from the file name *file*.  The  byte-code is "
"written to *cfile*, which defaults to *file* ``+`` ``'c'`` (``'o'`` if "
"optimization is enabled in the current interpreter).  If *dfile* is "
"specified, it is used as the name of the source file in error messages "
"instead of *file*.  If *doraise* is true, a :exc:`PyCompileError` is raised "
"when an error is encountered while compiling *file*. If *doraise* is false "
"(the default), an error string is written to ``sys.stderr``, but no "
"exception is raised."

"Compile several source files.  The files named in *args* (or on the command "
"line, if *args* is not specified) are compiled and the resulting bytecode is "
"cached in the normal manner.  This function does not search a directory "
"structure to locate source files; it only compiles files named explicitly."
