"It also looks for :file:`\\*.pkg` files beginning where ``*`` matches the "
"*name* argument.  This feature is similar to :file:`\\*.pth` files (see the :"
"mod:`site` module for more information), except that it doesn't special-case "
"lines starting with ``import``.  A :file:`\\*.pkg` file is trusted at face "
