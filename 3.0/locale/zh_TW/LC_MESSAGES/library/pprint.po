msgid ""
"The :mod:`pprint` module provides a capability to \"pretty-print\" arbitrary "
"Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the "
"interpreter. If the formatted structures include objects which are not "
"fundamental Python types, the representation may not be loadable.  This may "
"be the case if objects such as files, sockets, classes, or instances are "
"included, as well as many other builtin objects which are not representable "
"as Python constants."

"The formatted representation keeps objects on a single line if it can, and "
"breaks them onto multiple lines if they don't fit within the allowed width. "
"Construct :class:`PrettyPrinter` objects explicitly if you need to adjust "
"the width constraint."

"Construct a :class:`PrettyPrinter` instance.  This constructor understands "
"several keyword parameters.  An output stream may be set using the *stream* "
"keyword; the only method used on the stream object is the file protocol's :"
"meth:`write` method.  If not specified, the :class:`PrettyPrinter` adopts "
"``sys.stdout``.  Three additional parameters may be used to control the "
"formatted representation.  The keywords are *indent*, *depth*, and *width*.  "
"The amount of indentation added for each recursive level is specified by "
"*indent*; the default is one.  Other values can cause output to look a "
"little odd, but can make nesting easier to spot.  The number of levels which "
"may be printed is controlled by *depth*; if the data structure being printed "
"is too deep, the next contained level is replaced by ``...``.  By default, "
"there is no constraint on the depth of the objects being formatted.  The "
"desired output width is constrained using the *width* parameter; the default "
"is 80 characters.  If a structure cannot be formatted within the constrained "
"width, a best effort will be made."

"*object* that are affecting the presentation) as the keys; if an object "
"needs to be presented which is already represented in *context*, the third "
"return value should be ``True``.  Recursive calls to the :meth:`format` "
"method should add additional entries for containers to this dictionary.  The "
