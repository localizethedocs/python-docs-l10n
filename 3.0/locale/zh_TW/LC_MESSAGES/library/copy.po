"This module does not copy types like module, method, stack trace, stack "

"In order for a class to define its own copy implementation, it can define "
"special methods :meth:`__copy__` and :meth:`__deepcopy__`.  The former is "

"passed. The latter is called to implement the deep copy operation; it is "
"passed one argument, the memo dictionary.  If the :meth:`__deepcopy__` "
"implementation needs to make a deep copy of a component, it should call the :"
"func:`deepcopy` function with the component as first argument and the memo "
