"The :mod:`filecmp` module defines functions to compare files and "

"comparing files, see also the :mod:`difflib` module."

"contains the list of files match in both directories, *mismatch* includes "
"the names of those that don't, and *errros* lists the names of files which "
"could not be compared.  Files may be listed in *errors* because the user may "
"lack permission to read them or many other reasons, but always that the "
"comparison could not be done for some reason."
