msgid ":mod:`itertools` --- Functions creating iterators for efficient looping"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/itertools.rst:16
msgid ""
"This module implements a number of :term:`iterator` building blocks inspired "
"by constructs from the Haskell and SML programming languages.  Each has been "
"recast in a form suitable for Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/itertools.rst:20
msgid ""
"The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are "
"useful by themselves or in combination.  Standardization helps avoid the "
"readability and reliability problems which arise when many different "
"individuals create their own slightly varying implementations, each with "
"their own quirks and naming conventions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/itertools.rst:26
msgid ""
"The tools are designed to combine readily with one another.  This makes it "
"easy to construct more specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure "
"Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/itertools.rst:29
msgid ""
"For instance, SML provides a tabulation tool: ``tabulate(f)`` which produces "
"a sequence ``f(0), f(1), ...``.  But, this effect can be achieved in Python "
"by combining :func:`map` and :func:`count` to form ``map(f, count())``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/itertools.rst:33
msgid ""
"Likewise, the functional tools are designed to work well with the high-speed "
"functions provided by the :mod:`operator` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/itertools.rst:36
msgid ""
"Whether cast in pure python form or compiled code, tools that use iterators "
"are more memory efficient (and often faster) than their list based "
"counterparts. Adopting the principles of just-in-time manufacturing, they "
"create data when and where needed instead of consuming memory with the "
"computer equivalent of \"inventory\"."

"The operation of :func:`groupby` is similar to the ``uniq`` filter in Unix.  "
