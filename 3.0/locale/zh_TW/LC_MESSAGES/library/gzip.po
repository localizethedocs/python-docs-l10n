msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:7
msgid ""
"This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files "
"just like the GNU programs :program:`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` would."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:10
msgid "The data compression is provided by the :mod:`zlib` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:12
msgid ""
"The :mod:`gzip` module provides the :class:`GzipFile` class which is modeled "
"after Python's File Object. The :class:`GzipFile` class reads and writes :"
"program:`gzip`\\ -format files, automatically compressing or decompressing "
"the data so that it looks like an ordinary file object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:17
msgid ""
"Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the :program:"
"`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` programs, such  as those produced by :program:"
"`compress` and :program:`pack`, are not supported by this module."

"For other archive formats, see the :mod:`bz2`, :mod:`zipfile`, and :mod:"

msgid "The module defines the following items:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:29
msgid ""
"Constructor for the :class:`GzipFile` class, which simulates most of the "
"methods of a file object, with the exception of the :meth:`readinto` and :"
"meth:`truncate` methods.  At least one of *fileobj* and *filename* must be "
"given a non-trivial value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:34
msgid ""
"The new class instance is based on *fileobj*, which can be a regular file, "
"a :class:`StringIO` object, or any other object which simulates a file.  It "
"defaults to ``None``, in which case *filename* is opened to provide a file "
"object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:39
msgid ""
"When *fileobj* is not ``None``, the *filename* argument is only used to be "
"included in the :program:`gzip` file header, which may includes the original "
"filename of the uncompressed file.  It defaults to the filename of "
"*fileobj*, if discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string, and "
"in this case the original filename is not included in the header."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:45
msgid ""
"The *mode* argument can be any of ``'r'``, ``'rb'``, ``'a'``, ``'ab'``, "
"``'w'``, or ``'wb'``, depending on whether the file will be read or "
"written.  The default is the mode of *fileobj* if discernible; otherwise, "
"the default is ``'rb'``. If not given, the 'b' flag will be added to the "
"mode to ensure the file is opened in binary mode for cross-platform "
"portability."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:51
msgid ""
"The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from ``1`` to ``9`` controlling "
"the level of compression; ``1`` is fastest and produces the least "
"compression, and ``9`` is slowest and produces the most compression.  The "
"default is ``9``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:55
msgid ""
"Calling a :class:`GzipFile` object's :meth:`close` method does not close "
"*fileobj*, since you might wish to append more material after the compressed "
"data.  This also allows you to pass a :class:`StringIO` object opened for "
"writing as *fileobj*, and retrieve the resulting memory buffer using the :"
"class:`StringIO` object's :meth:`getvalue` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:64
msgid ""
"This is a shorthand for ``GzipFile(filename,`` ``mode,`` ``compresslevel)``. "
"The *filename* argument is required; *mode* defaults to ``'rb'`` and "
"*compresslevel* defaults to ``9``."
