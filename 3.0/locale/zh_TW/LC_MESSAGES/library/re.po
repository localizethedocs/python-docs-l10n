"Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings as well as 8-"
"bit strings. However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: "
"that is, you cannot match an Unicode string with a byte pattern or vice-"
"versa; similarly, when asking for a substition, the replacement string must "
"be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string."

"Regular expressions use the backslash character (``'\\'``) to indicate "
"special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking "
"their special meaning.  This collides with Python's usage of the same "
"character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a "
"literal backslash, one might have to write ``'\\\\\\\\'`` as the pattern "
"string, because the regular expression must be ``\\\\``, and each backslash "
"must be expressed as ``\\\\`` inside a regular Python string literal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/re.rst:31
msgid ""
"The solution is to use Python's raw string notation for regular expression "
"patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal "
"prefixed with ``'r'``.  So ``r\"\\n\"`` is a two-character string containing "
"``'\\'`` and ``'n'``, while ``\"\\n\"`` is a one-character string containing "
"a newline.  Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw "
"string notation."

"A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the "
"functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a "

"particular string, which comes down to the same thing)."

"Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions; if "
"*A* and *B* are both regular expressions, then *AB* is also a regular "
"expression. In general, if a string *p* matches *A* and another string *q* "
"matches *B*, the string *pq* will match AB.  This holds unless *A* or *B* "
"contain low precedence operations; boundary conditions between *A* and *B*; "
"or have numbered group references.  Thus, complex expressions can easily be "
"constructed from simpler primitive expressions like the ones described "
"here.  For details of the theory and implementation of regular expressions, "

"Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most "
"ordinary characters, like ``'A'``, ``'a'``, or ``'0'``, are the simplest "
"regular expressions; they simply match themselves.  You can concatenate "
"ordinary characters, so ``last`` matches the string ``'last'``.  (In the "

"without quotes, and strings to be matched ``'in single quotes'``.)"
