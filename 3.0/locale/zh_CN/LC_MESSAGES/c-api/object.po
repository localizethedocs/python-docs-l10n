"Subclass determination is done in a fairly straightforward way, but includes "
"a wrinkle that implementors of extensions to the class system may want to be "
"aware of.  If :class:`A` and :class:`B` are class objects, :class:`B` is a "
"subclass of :class:`A` if it inherits from :class:`A` either directly or "
"indirectly.  If either is not a class object, a more general mechanism is "
"used to determine the class relationship of the two objects.  When testing "
"if *B* is a subclass of *A*, if *A* is *B*, :cfunc:`PyObject_IsSubclass` "
"returns true.  If *A* and *B* are different objects, *B*'s :attr:`__bases__` "
"attribute is searched in a depth-first fashion for *A* --- the presence of "
"the :attr:`__bases__` attribute is considered sufficient for this "
"determination."
