"This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as "
"defined in :rfc:`1521`: \"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part "
"One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message "
"Bodies\". The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there are "
"relatively few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme available "
"via the :mod:`base64` module is more compact if there are many such "
"characters, as when sending a graphics file."

"Decode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting decoded "
"binary data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must either be file "
"objects or objects that mimic the file object interface. *input* will be "
"read until ``input.readline()`` returns an empty string. If the optional "
"argument *header* is present and true, underscore will be decoded as space. "
"This is used to decode \"Q\"-encoded headers as described in :rfc:`1522`: "
