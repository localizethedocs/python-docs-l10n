"Resources usage can be limited using the :func:`setrlimit` function "
"described below. Each resource is controlled by a pair of limits: a soft "
"limit and a hard limit. The soft limit is the current limit, and may be "
"lowered or raised by a process over time. The soft limit can never exceed "
"the hard limit. The hard limit can be lowered to any value greater than the "
"soft limit, but not raised. (Only processes with the effective UID of the "
"super-user can raise a hard limit.)"
