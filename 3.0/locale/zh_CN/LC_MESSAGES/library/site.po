"It starts by constructing up to four directories from a head and a tail "

"empty heads are skipped.  For the tail part, it uses the empty string and "
"then :file:`lib/site-packages` (on Windows) or :file:`lib/python|version|/"
"site-packages` and then :file:`lib/site-python` (on Unix and Macintosh).  "
"For each of the distinct head-tail combinations, it sees if it refers to an "
