"The :mod:`textwrap` module provides two convenience functions, :func:`wrap` "
"and :func:`fill`, as well as :class:`TextWrapper`, the class that does all "
"the work, and a utility function  :func:`dedent`.  If you're just wrapping "
"or filling one or two  text strings, the convenience functions should be "
"good enough; otherwise,  you should use an instance of :class:`TextWrapper` "
"for efficiency."
