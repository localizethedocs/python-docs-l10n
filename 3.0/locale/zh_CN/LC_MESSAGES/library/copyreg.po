"The :mod:`copyreg` module provides support for the :mod:`pickle` and :mod:"
"`cPickle` modules.  The :mod:`copy` module is likely to use this in the "
"future as well.  It provides configuration information about object "
"constructors which are not classes.  Such constructors may be factory "
"functions or class instances."

"Declares *object* to be a valid constructor.  If *object* is not callable "
"(and hence not valid as a constructor), raises :exc:`TypeError`."

"Declares that *function* should be used as a \"reduction\" function for "
"objects of type *type*.  *function* should return either a string or a tuple "

"The optional *constructor* parameter, if provided, is a callable object "
"which can be used to reconstruct the object when called with the tuple of "
"arguments returned by *function* at pickling time.  :exc:`TypeError` will be "
"raised if *object* is a class or *constructor* is not callable."
