"This module provides some utility functions to support installing Python "
"libraries.  These functions compile Python source files in a directory tree, "
"allowing users without permission to write to the libraries to take "
"advantage of cached byte-code files."

"This module may also be used as a script (using the :option:`-m` Python "
"flag) to compile Python sources.  Directories to recursively traverse "
"(passing :option:`-l` stops the recursive behavior) for sources are listed "
"on the command line.  If no arguments are given, the invocation is "
"equivalent to ``-l sys.path``.  Printing lists of the files compiled can be "
"disabled with the :option:`-q` flag.  In addition, the :option:`-x` option "
"takes a regular expression argument.  All files that match the expression "
"will be skipped."

"Recursively descend the directory tree named by *dir*, compiling all :file:`."
"py` files along the way.  The *maxlevels* parameter is used to limit the "
"depth of the recursion; it defaults to ``10``.  If *ddir* is given, it is "
"used as the base path from  which the filenames used in error messages will "
"be generated. If *force* is true, modules are re-compiled even if the "
"timestamps are up to date."
