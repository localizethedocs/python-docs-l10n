msgid ""
"The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern "
"according to the rules used by the Unix shell.  No tilde expansion is done, "
"but ``*``, ``?``, and character ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be "
"correctly matched.  This is done by using the :func:`os.listdir` and :func:"
"`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions in concert, and not by actually invoking a "
"subshell.  (For tilde and shell variable expansion, use :func:`os.path."
"expanduser` and :func:`os.path.expandvars`.)"

"Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which must "
"be a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be either "
"absolute (like :file:`/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like :file:"
"`../../Tools/\\*/\\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken "
"symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell)."

"Return an :term:`iterator` which yields the same values as :func:`glob` "
"without actually storing them all simultaneously."

"For example, consider a directory containing only the following files: :file:"
"`1.gif`, :file:`2.txt`, and :file:`card.gif`.  :func:`glob` will produce the "
"following results.  Notice how any leading components of the path are "
"preserved. ::"
