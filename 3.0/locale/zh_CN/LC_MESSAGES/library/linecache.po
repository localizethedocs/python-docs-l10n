msgid ""
"The :mod:`linecache` module allows one to get any line from any file, while "
"attempting to optimize internally, using a cache, the common case where many "
"lines are read from a single file.  This is used by the :mod:`traceback` "
"module to retrieve source lines for inclusion in  the formatted traceback."

msgid "The :mod:`linecache` module defines the following functions:"

#: ../../../library/linecache.rst:20
msgid ""
"Get line *lineno* from file named *filename*. This function will never throw "
"an exception --- it will return ``''`` on errors (the terminating newline "
"character will be included for lines that are found)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/linecache.rst:26
msgid ""
"If a file named *filename* is not found, the function will look for it in "
"the module search path, ``sys.path``, after first checking for a :pep:`302` "
"``__loader__`` in *module_globals*, in case the module was imported from a "
"zipfile or other non-filesystem import source."

"Clear the cache.  Use this function if you no longer need lines from files "
"previously read using :func:`getline`."

msgid ""
"Check the cache for validity.  Use this function if files in the cache  may "
"have changed on disk, and you require the updated version.  If *filename* is "
"omitted, it will check all the entries in the cache."
