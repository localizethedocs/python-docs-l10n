":cfunc:`PyOS_snprintf` and :cfunc:`PyOS_vsnprintf` wrap the Standard C "
"library functions :cfunc:`snprintf` and :cfunc:`vsnprintf`. Their purpose is "
"to guarantee consistent behavior in corner cases, which the Standard C "
"functions do not."

"The wrappers ensure that *str*[*size*-1] is always ``'\\0'`` upon return. "
"They never write more than *size* bytes (including the trailing ``'\\0'``) "
"into str. Both functions require that ``str != NULL``, ``size > 0`` and "
"``format != NULL``."
