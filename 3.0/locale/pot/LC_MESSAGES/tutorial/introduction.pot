"In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the "
"presence or absence of prompts (``>>>`` and ``...``): to repeat the example, "
"you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines "
"that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a "
"secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a "

"the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string "
"literal.  A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. "
"Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they "

"Starting with Python 3.0 all strings support Unicode (see http://www.unicode."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/introduction.rst:426
msgid ""
"Unicode has the advantage of providing one ordinal for every character in "
"every script used in modern and ancient texts. Previously, there were only "
"256 possible ordinals for script characters. Texts were typically bound to a "
"code page which mapped the ordinals to script characters. This lead to very "
"much confusion especially with respect to internationalization (usually "
"written as ``i18n`` --- ``'i'`` + 18 characters + ``'n'``) of software.  "
"Unicode solves these problems by defining one code page for all scripts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/introduction.rst:434

"If you want to include special characters in a string, you can do so by "
"using the Python *Unicode-Escape* encoding. The following example shows how::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/introduction.rst:441
msgid ""
"The escape sequence ``\\u0020`` indicates to insert the Unicode character "
"with the ordinal value 0x0020 (the space character) at the given position."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/introduction.rst:444
msgid ""
"Other characters are interpreted by using their respective ordinal values "
"directly as Unicode ordinals.  If you have literal strings in the standard "
"Latin-1 encoding that is used in many Western countries, you will find it "
"convenient that the lower 256 characters of Unicode are the same as the 256 "
"characters of Latin-1."
