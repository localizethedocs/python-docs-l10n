msgid ":mod:`pydoc` --- Documentation generator and online help system"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`pydoc` module automatically generates documentation from Python "
"modules.  The documentation can be presented as pages of text on the "
"console, served to a Web browser, or saved to HTML files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pydoc.rst:20
msgid ""
"The built-in function :func:`help` invokes the online help system in the "
"interactive interpreter, which uses :mod:`pydoc` to generate its "
"documentation as text on the console.  The same text documentation can also "
"be viewed from outside the Python interpreter by running :program:`pydoc` as "
"a script at the operating system's command prompt. For example, running ::"

"at a shell prompt will display documentation on the :mod:`sys` module, in a "
"style similar to the manual pages shown by the Unix :program:`man` command.  "
"The argument to :program:`pydoc` can be the name of a function, module, or "
"package, or a dotted reference to a class, method, or function within a "
"module or module in a package.  If the argument to :program:`pydoc` looks "
"like a path (that is, it contains the path separator for your operating "
"system, such as a slash in Unix), and refers to an existing Python source "
"file, then documentation is produced for that file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pydoc.rst:39
msgid ""
"In order to find objects and their documentation, :mod:`pydoc` imports the "
"module(s) to be documented.  Therefore, any code on module level will be "
"executed on that occasion.  Use an ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` guard to "
"only execute code when a file is invoked as a script and not just imported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pydoc.rst:44
msgid ""
"Specifying a :option:`-w` flag before the argument will cause HTML "
"documentation to be written out to a file in the current directory, instead "
"of displaying text on the console."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pydoc.rst:48
msgid ""
"Specifying a :option:`-k` flag before the argument will search the synopsis "
"lines of all available modules for the keyword given as the argument, again "
"in a manner similar to the Unix :program:`man` command.  The synopsis line "
"of a module is the first line of its documentation string."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pydoc.rst:53
msgid ""
"You can also use :program:`pydoc` to start an HTTP server on the local "
"machine that will serve documentation to visiting Web browsers. :program:"
"`pydoc` :option:`-p 1234` will start a HTTP server on port 1234, allowing "
"you to browse the documentation at ``http://localhost:1234/`` in your "
"preferred Web browser. :program:`pydoc` :option:`-g` will start the server "
"and additionally bring up a small :mod:`Tkinter`\\ -based graphical "
"interface to help you search for documentation pages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/pydoc.rst:61
msgid ""
"When :program:`pydoc` generates documentation, it uses the current "
"environment and path to locate modules.  Thus, invoking :program:`pydoc` :"
"option:`spam` documents precisely the version of the module you would get if "
"you started the Python interpreter and typed ``import spam``."

"Module docs for core modules are assumed to reside in http://docs.python.org/"
"library/.  This can be overridden by setting the :envvar:`PYTHONDOCS` "
"environment variable to a different URL or to a local directory containing "
"the Library Reference Manual pages."
