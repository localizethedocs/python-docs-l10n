"The :mod:`runpy` module is used to locate and run Python modules without "
"importing them first. Its main use is to implement the :option:`-m` command "
"line switch that allows scripts to be located using the Python module "
"namespace rather than the filesystem."

#: ../../../library/runpy.rst:24

"Execute the code of the specified module and return the resulting module "
"globals dictionary. The module's code is first located using the standard "
"import mechanism (refer to PEP 302 for details) and then executed in a fresh "
"module namespace."

"The optional dictionary argument *init_globals* may be used to pre-populate "
"the globals dictionary before the code is executed. The supplied dictionary "
"will not be modified. If any of the special global variables below are "
"defined in the supplied dictionary, those definitions are overridden by the "
"``run_module`` function."

"The special global variables ``__name__``, ``__file__``, ``__loader__`` and "
"``__builtins__`` are set in the globals dictionary before the module code is "
"executed."

"``__name__`` is set to *run_name* if this optional argument is supplied, and "
"the *mod_name* argument otherwise."

"``__loader__`` is set to the PEP 302 module loader used to retrieve the code "
"for the module (This loader may be a wrapper around the standard import "
"mechanism)."

"``__builtins__`` is automatically initialised with a reference to the top "

"If the argument *alter_sys* is supplied and evaluates to ``True``, then "

"being executed. Both ``sys.argv[0]`` and ``sys.modules[__name__]`` are "

"Note that this manipulation of :mod:`sys` is not thread-safe. Other threads "
