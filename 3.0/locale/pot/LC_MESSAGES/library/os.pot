"This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent "
"functionality.  If you just want to read or write a file see :func:`open`, "
"if you want to manipulate paths, see the :mod:`os.path` module, and if you "
"want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the :mod:"
"`fileinput` module.  For creating temporary files and directories see the :"
"mod:`tempfile` module, and for high-level file and directory handling see "
"the :mod:`shutil` module."

"The design of all built-in operating system dependent modules of Python is "

"originated with the POSIX interface)."
