"The :class:`scheduler` class defines a generic interface to scheduling "
"events. It needs two functions to actually deal with the \"outside world\" "
"--- *timefunc* should be callable without arguments, and return  a number "
"(the \"time\", in any units whatsoever).  The *delayfunc* function should be "
"callable with one argument, compatible with the output of *timefunc*, and "
"should delay that many time units. *delayfunc* will also be called with the "
"argument ``0`` after each event is run to allow other threads an opportunity "
"to run in multi-threaded applications."

"In multi-threaded environments, the :class:`scheduler` class has limitations "
"with respect to thread-safety, inability to insert a new task before the one "
"currently pending in a running scheduler, and holding up the main thread "
"until the event queue is empty.  Instead, the preferred approach is to use "
"the :class:`threading.Timer` class instead."

msgid ""
"Schedule a new event. The *time* argument should be a numeric type "
"compatible with the return value of the *timefunc* function passed  to the "
"constructor. Events scheduled for the same *time* will be executed in the "
"order of their *priority*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/sched.rst:86
msgid ""
"Executing the event means executing ``action(*argument)``.  *argument* must "
"be a sequence holding the parameters for *action*."

msgid ""
"Return value is an event which may be used for later cancellation of the "
"event (see :meth:`cancel`)."

"Schedule an event for *delay* more time units. Other then the relative time, "
"the other arguments, the effect and the return value are the same as those "
"for :meth:`enterabs`."

"Remove the event from the queue. If *event* is not an event currently in the "
"queue, this method will raise a :exc:`RuntimeError`."

"Run all scheduled events. This function will wait  (using the :func:"

msgid ""
"Either *action* or *delayfunc* can raise an exception.  In either case, the "
"scheduler will maintain a consistent state and propagate the exception.  If "
"an exception is raised by *action*, the event will not be attempted in "
"future calls to :meth:`run`."

#: ../../../library/sched.rst:122
msgid ""
"If a sequence of events takes longer to run than the time available before "
"the next event, the scheduler will simply fall behind.  No events will be "

"longer pertinent."
