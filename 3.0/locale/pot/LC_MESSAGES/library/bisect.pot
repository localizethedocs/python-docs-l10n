"This module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without "
"having to sort the list after each insertion.  For long lists of items with "
"expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over the more "
"common approach.  The module is called :mod:`bisect` because it uses a basic "
"bisection algorithm to do its work.  The source code may be most useful as a "
"working example of the algorithm (the boundary conditions are already "
"right!)."

"Locate the proper insertion point for *item* in *list* to maintain sorted "
"order. The parameters *lo* and *hi* may be used to specify a subset of the "
"list which should be considered; by default the entire list is used.  If "
"*item* is already present in *list*, the insertion point will be before (to "
"the left of) any existing entries.  The return value is suitable for use as "
"the first parameter to ``list.insert()``.  This assumes that *list* is "
"already sorted."

"The :func:`bisect` function is generally useful for categorizing numeric "
"data. This example uses :func:`bisect` to look up a letter grade for an exam "
"total (say) based on a set of ordered numeric breakpoints: 85 and up is an "
"'A', 75..84 is a 'B', etc."
