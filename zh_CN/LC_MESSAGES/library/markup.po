"Python supports a variety of modules to work with various forms of "
"structured data markup.  This includes modules to work with the Standard "
"Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), "

"It is important to note that modules in the :mod:`xml` package require that "
"there be at least one SAX-compliant XML parser available. Starting with "
"Python 2.3, the Expat parser is included with Python, so the :mod:`xml."
"parsers.expat` module will always be available. You may still want to be "
"aware of the `PyXML add-on package <http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/>`_; that "
"package provides an extended set of XML libraries for Python."
