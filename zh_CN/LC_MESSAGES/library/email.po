msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`email` package is a library for managing email messages, including "
"MIME and other :rfc:`2822`\\ -based message documents.  It is specifically "
"*not* designed to do any sending of email messages to SMTP (:rfc:`2821`), "
"NNTP, or other servers; those are functions of modules such as :mod:"
"`smtplib` and :mod:`nntplib`. The :mod:`email` package attempts to be as RFC-"
"compliant as possible, supporting in addition to :rfc:`2822`, such MIME-"
"related RFCs as :rfc:`2045`, :rfc:`2046`, :rfc:`2047`, and :rfc:`2231`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/email.rst:20
msgid ""
"The primary distinguishing feature of the :mod:`email` package is that it "
"splits the parsing and generating of email messages from the internal "
"*object model* representation of email.  Applications using the :mod:`email` "
"package deal primarily with objects; you can add sub-objects to messages, "
"remove sub-objects from messages, completely re-arrange the contents, etc.  "
"There is a separate parser and a separate generator which handles the "
"transformation from flat text to the object model, and then back to flat "
"text again.  There are also handy subclasses for some common MIME object "
"types, and a few miscellaneous utilities that help with such common tasks as "
"extracting and parsing message field values, creating RFC-compliant dates, "
"etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/email.rst:31
msgid ""
"The following sections describe the functionality of the :mod:`email` "
"package. The ordering follows a progression that should be common in "
"applications: an email message is read as flat text from a file or other "
"source, the text is parsed to produce the object structure of the email "
"message, this structure is manipulated, and finally, the object tree is "
"rendered back into flat text."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/email.rst:37
msgid ""
"It is perfectly feasible to create the object structure out of whole cloth "
"--- i.e. completely from scratch.  From there, a similar progression can be "
"taken as above."

msgid ""
"Also included are detailed specifications of all the classes and modules "
"that the :mod:`email` package provides, the exception classes you might "
"encounter while using the :mod:`email` package, some auxiliary utilities, "
"and a few examples.  For users of the older :mod:`mimelib` package, or "
"previous versions of the :mod:`email` package, a section on differences and "
"porting is provided."
