"Names for built-in exceptions and functions and a number of constants are "
"found in a separate  symbol table.  This table is searched last when the "
"interpreter looks up the meaning of a name, so local and global user-defined "
"names can override built-in names.  Built-in types are described together "
"here for easy reference."

"The tables in this chapter document the priorities of operators by listing "
"them in order of ascending priority (within a table) and grouping operators "
"that have the same priority in the same box. Binary operators of the same "
"priority group from left to right. (Unary operators group from right to "
"left, but there you have no real choice.)  See :ref:`operator-summary` for "
"the complete picture on operator priorities."
