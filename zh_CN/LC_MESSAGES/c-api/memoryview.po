"A :class:`memoryview` object exposes the C level :ref:`buffer interface "
"<bufferobjects>` as a Python object which can then be passed around like any "
"other object."

msgid ""
"Create a memoryview object from an object that provides the buffer "
"interface. If *obj* supports writable buffer exports, the memoryview object "
"will be readable and writable, otherwise it will be read-only."

msgid ""
"Create a memoryview object wrapping the given buffer structure *view*. The "
"memoryview object then owns the buffer represented by *view*, which means "
"you shouldn't try to call :c:func:`PyBuffer_Release` yourself: it will be "
"done on deallocation of the memoryview object."

msgid ""
"Create a memoryview object to a contiguous chunk of memory (in either 'C' or "
"'F'ortran *order*) from an object that defines the buffer interface. If "
"memory is contiguous, the memoryview object points to the original memory. "
"Otherwise, a copy is made and the memoryview points to a new bytes object."

"Return true if the object *obj* is a memoryview object.  It is not currently "
"allowed to create subclasses of :class:`memoryview`."

"Return a pointer to the buffer structure wrapped by the given memoryview "
"object.  The object **must** be a memoryview instance; this macro doesn't "
"check its type, you must do it yourself or you will risk crashes."
