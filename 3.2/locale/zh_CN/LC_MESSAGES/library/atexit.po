msgid ""
"The :mod:`atexit` module defines functions to register and unregister "
"cleanup functions.  Functions thus registered are automatically executed "
"upon normal interpreter termination.  The order in which the functions are "
"called is not defined; if you have cleanup operations that depend on each "
"other, you should wrap them in a function and register that one.  This "
"keeps :mod:`atexit` simple."

"Note: the functions registered via this module are not called when the "
"program is killed by a signal not handled by Python, when a Python fatal "
"internal error is detected, or when :func:`os._exit` is called."

"Register *func* as a function to be executed at termination.  Any optional "
"arguments that are to be passed to *func* must be passed as arguments to :"
"func:`register`.  It is possible to register the same function and arguments "
"more than once."

#: ../../../library/atexit.rst:28
msgid ""
"At normal program termination (for instance, if :func:`sys.exit` is called "
"or the main module's execution completes), all functions registered are "
"called in last in, first out order.  The assumption is that lower level "
"modules will normally be imported before higher level modules and thus must "
"be cleaned up later."

"If an exception is raised during execution of the exit handlers, a traceback "
"is printed (unless :exc:`SystemExit` is raised) and the exception "
"information is saved.  After all exit handlers have had a chance to run the "
"last exception to be raised is re-raised."
