"This is a simplified interface to :c:func:`PyImport_ImportModuleEx` below, "
"leaving the *globals* and *locals* arguments set to *NULL* and *level* set "
"to 0.  When the *name* argument contains a dot (when it specifies a "
"submodule of a package), the *fromlist* argument is set to the list "
"``['*']`` so that the return value is the named module rather than the top-"
"level package containing it as would otherwise be the case.  (Unfortunately, "
"this has an additional side effect when *name* in fact specifies a "
"subpackage instead of a submodule: the submodules specified in the package's "
"``__all__`` variable are  loaded.)  Return a new reference to the imported "
"module, or *NULL* with an exception set on failure.  A failing import of a "
"module doesn't leave the module in :data:`sys.modules`."

"This version of :c:func:`PyImport_ImportModule` does not block. It's "
"intended to be used in C functions that import other modules to execute a "
"function. The import may block if another thread holds the import lock. The "
"function :c:func:`PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock` never blocks. It first tries "
"to fetch the module from sys.modules and falls back to :c:func:"
"`PyImport_ImportModule` unless the lock is held, in which case the function "
