"Convert the characters ``&``, ``<`` and ``>`` in string *s* to HTML-safe "
"sequences.  Use this if you need to display text that might contain such "
"characters in HTML.  If the optional flag *quote* is true, the characters "
"(``\"``) and (``'``) are also translated; this helps for inclusion in an "
"HTML attribute value delimited by quotes, as in ``<a href=\"...\">``."
