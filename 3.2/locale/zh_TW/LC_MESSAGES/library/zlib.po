"For applications that require data compression, the functions in this module "
"allow compression and decompression, using the zlib library. The zlib "
"library has its own home page at http://www.zlib.net.   There are known "
"incompatibilities between the Python module and versions of the zlib library "
"earlier than 1.1.3; 1.1.3 has a security vulnerability, so we recommend "
"using 1.1.4 or later."
