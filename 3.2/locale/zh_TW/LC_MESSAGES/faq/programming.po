"This is because when you make an assignment to a variable in a scope, that "

"In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are "

"Though a bit surprising at first, a moment's consideration explains this.  "
"On one hand, requiring :keyword:`global` for assigned variables provides a "

"required for all global references, you'd be using ``global`` all the time.  "
"You'd have to declare as global every reference to a built-in function or to "
"a component of an imported module.  This clutter would defeat the usefulness "
"of the ``global`` declaration for identifying side-effects."
