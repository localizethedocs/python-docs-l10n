msgid ":mod:`gc` --- Garbage Collector interface"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gc.rst:10
msgid ""
"This module provides an interface to the optional garbage collector.  It "
"provides the ability to disable the collector, tune the collection "
"frequency, and set debugging options.  It also provides access to "
"unreachable objects that the collector found but cannot free.  Since the "
"collector supplements the reference counting already used in Python, you can "
"disable the collector if you are sure your program does not create reference "
"cycles.  Automatic collection can be disabled by calling ``gc.disable()``.  "
"To debug a leaking program call ``gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_LEAK)``. Notice that "
"this includes ``gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL``, causing garbage-collected objects to be "
"saved in gc.garbage for inspection."

"The GC classifies objects into three generations depending on how many "
"collection sweeps they have survived.  New objects are placed in the "
"youngest generation (generation ``0``).  If an object survives a collection "
"it is moved into the next older generation.  Since generation ``2`` is the "
"oldest generation, objects in that generation remain there after a "
"collection.  In order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of "
"the number object allocations and deallocations since the last collection.  "
"When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds "
"*threshold0*, collection starts.  Initially only generation ``0`` is "
"examined.  If generation ``0`` has been examined more than *threshold1* "
"times since generation ``1`` has been examined, then generation ``1`` is "
"examined as well.  Similarly, *threshold2* controls the number of "
"collections of generation ``1`` before collecting generation ``2``."

"A list of objects which the collector found to be unreachable but could not "

"methods and are part of a reference cycle cause the entire reference cycle "
"to be uncollectable, including objects not necessarily in the cycle but "
"reachable only from it. Python doesn't collect such cycles automatically "
"because, in general, it isn't possible for Python to guess a safe order in "
"which to run the :meth:`__del__` methods.  If you know a safe order, you can "
"force the issue by examining the *garbage* list, and explicitly breaking "
"cycles due to your objects within the list.  Note that these objects are "
"kept alive even so by virtue of being in the *garbage* list, so they should "
"be removed from *garbage* too.  For example, after breaking cycles, do ``del "
"gc.garbage[:]`` to empty the list.  It's generally better to avoid the issue "
"by not creating cycles containing objects with :meth:`__del__` methods, and "
"*garbage* can be examined in that case to verify that no such cycles are "
