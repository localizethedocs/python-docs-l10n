"This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and "
"message digest algorithms.  Included are the FIPS secure hash algorithms "
"SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512 (defined in FIPS 180-2) as well as "
"RSA's MD5 algorithm (defined in Internet :rfc:`1321`).  The terms \"secure "
"hash\" and \"message digest\" are interchangeable.  Older algorithms were "
"called message digests.  The modern term is secure hash."
