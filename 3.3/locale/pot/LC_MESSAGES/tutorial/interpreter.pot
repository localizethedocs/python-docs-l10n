"The Python interpreter is usually installed as :file:`/usr/local/bin/"

"Typing an end-of-file character (:kbd:`Control-D` on Unix, :kbd:`Control-Z` "

"the following command: ``quit()``."

"The interpreter's line-editing features usually aren't very sophisticated.  "
"On Unix, whoever installed the interpreter may have enabled support for the "
"GNU readline library, which adds more elaborate interactive editing and "
"history features. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line "
"editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you "
"get.  If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix :ref:`tut-"
"interacting` for an introduction to the keys.  If nothing appears to happen, "
"or if ``^P`` is echoed, command line editing isn't available; you'll only be "
"able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line."

"The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with "
"standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands "
"interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as "
"standard input, it reads and executes a *script* from that file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:53
msgid ""
"A second way of starting the interpreter is ``python -c command [arg] ...``, "
"which executes the statement(s) in *command*, analogous to the shell's :"
"option:`-c` option.  Since Python statements often contain spaces or other "
"characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote "
"*command* in its entirety with single quotes."

"Some Python modules are also useful as scripts.  These can be invoked using "
"``python -m module [arg] ...``, which executes the source file for *module* "

#: ../../../tutorial/interpreter.rst:63

"When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the "

"When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments "
"thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the ``argv`` "
"variable in the ``sys`` module.  You can access this list by executing "
"``import sys``.  The length of the list is at least one; when no script and "
"no arguments are given, ``sys.argv[0]`` is an empty string.  When the script "
"name is given as ``'-'`` (meaning  standard input), ``sys.argv[0]`` is set "
"to ``'-'``.  When :option:`-c` *command* is used, ``sys.argv[0]`` is set to "
"``'-c'``.  When :option:`-m` *module* is used, ``sys.argv[0]``  is set to "
"the full name of the located module.  Options found after  :option:`-c` "
"*command* or :option:`-m` *module* are not consumed  by the Python "
"interpreter's option processing but left in ``sys.argv`` for  the command or "
"module to handle."

"dots (``...``). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version "

"When an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack "

"By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8.  In that "
