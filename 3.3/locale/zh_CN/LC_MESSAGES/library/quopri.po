"This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as "
"defined in :rfc:`1521`: \"MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part "
"One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message "
"Bodies\". The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there are "
"relatively few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme available "
"via the :mod:`base64` module is more compact if there are many such "
"characters, as when sending a graphics file."
