"The :mod:`textwrap` module provides two convenience functions, :func:`wrap` "
"and :func:`fill`, as well as :class:`TextWrapper`, the class that does all "
"the work, and two utility functions, :func:`dedent` and :func:`indent`.  If "
"you're just wrapping or filling one or two  text strings, the convenience "
"functions should be good enough; otherwise,  you should use an instance of :"
"class:`TextWrapper` for efficiency."

"(default: ``False``) If true, :class:`TextWrapper` attempts to detect "

"However, the sentence detection algorithm is imperfect: it assumes that a "
"sentence ending consists of a lowercase letter followed by one of ``'.'``, "
"``'!'``, or ``'?'``, possibly followed by one of ``'\"'`` or ``\"'\"``, "

"Since the sentence detection algorithm relies on ``string.lowercase`` for "

"English-language texts."

#: ../../../library/textwrap.rst:221
msgid ""
"(default: ``True``) If true, then words longer than :attr:`width` will be "
"broken in order to ensure that no lines are longer than :attr:`width`.  If "
"it is false, long words will not be broken, and some lines may be longer "
"than :attr:`width`.  (Long words will be put on a line by themselves, in "

"(default: ``True``) If true, wrapping will occur preferably on whitespaces "

"false, only whitespaces will be considered as potentially good places for "
"line breaks, but you need to set :attr:`break_long_words` to false if you "
