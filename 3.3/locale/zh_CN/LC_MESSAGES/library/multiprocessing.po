":mod:`multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using "
"an API similar to the :mod:`threading` module.  The :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping "
"the :term:`Global Interpreter Lock` by using subprocesses instead of "
"threads.  Due to this, the :mod:`multiprocessing` module allows the "
"programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine.  It "
"runs on both Unix and Windows."
