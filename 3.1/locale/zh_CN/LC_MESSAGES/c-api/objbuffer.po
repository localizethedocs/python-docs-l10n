"These functions were part of the \"old buffer protocol\" API in Python 2. In "
"Python 3, this protocol doesn't exist anymore but the functions are still "
"exposed to ease porting 2.x code.  They act as a compatibility wrapper "
"around the :ref:`new buffer protocol <bufferobjects>`, but they don't give "
"you control over the lifetime of the resources acquired when a buffer is "
"exported."

"Therefore, it is recommended that you call :cfunc:`PyObject_GetBuffer` (or "
"the ``y*`` or ``w*`` :ref:`format codes <arg-parsing>` with the :cfunc:"
"`PyArg_ParseTuple` family of functions) to get a buffer view over an object, "
"and :cfunc:`PyBuffer_Release` when the buffer view can be released."
