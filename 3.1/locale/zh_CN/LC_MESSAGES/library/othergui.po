"is a toolkit for building high-level compound widgets in Python using the :"
"mod:`tkinter` package.  It consists of a set of base classes and a library "
"of flexible and extensible megawidgets built on this foundation. These "
"megawidgets include notebooks, comboboxes, selection widgets, paned widgets, "
"scrolled widgets, dialog windows, etc.  Also, with the Pmw.Blt interface to "
"BLT, the busy, graph, stripchart, tabset and vector commands are be "
"available."

"The initial ideas for Pmw were taken from the Tk ``itcl`` extensions ``[incr "
"Tk]`` by Michael McLennan and ``[incr Widgets]`` by Mark Ulferts. Several of "
"the megawidgets are direct translations from the itcl to Python. It offers "
"most of the range of widgets that ``[incr Widgets]`` does, and is almost as "
"complete as Tix, lacking however Tix's fast :class:`HList` widget for "
"drawing trees."

"is a library that allows you to write new Tkinter widgets in pure Python.  "
"The WCK framework gives you full control over widget creation, "
"configuration, screen appearance, and event handling.  WCK widgets can be "
"very fast and light-weight, since they can operate directly on Python data "
"structures, without having to transfer data through the Tk/Tcl layer."

"wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for Python that is built around the "
"popular `wxWidgets <http://www.wxwidgets.org/>`_ (formerly wxWindows) C++ "
"toolkit.  It provides a native look and feel for applications on Windows, "
"Mac OS X, and Unix systems by using each platform's native widgets where "
"ever possible, (GTK+ on Unix-like systems).  In addition to an extensive set "
"of widgets, wxPython provides classes for online documentation and context "
"sensitive help, printing, HTML viewing, low-level device context drawing, "
"drag and drop, system clipboard access, an XML-based resource format and "
"more, including an ever growing library of user-contributed modules.  "
