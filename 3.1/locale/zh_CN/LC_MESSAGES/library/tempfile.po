msgid ":mod:`tempfile` --- Generate temporary files and directories"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:15
msgid ""
"This module generates temporary files and directories.  It works on all "
"supported platforms.  It provides three new functions, :func:"
"`NamedTemporaryFile`, :func:`mkstemp`, and :func:`mkdtemp`, which should "
"eliminate all remaining need to use the insecure :func:`mktemp` function. "
"Temporary file names created by this module no longer contain the process "
"ID; instead a string of six random characters is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:22
msgid ""
"Also, all the user-callable functions now take additional arguments which "
"allow direct control over the location and name of temporary files.  It is "
"no longer necessary to use the global *tempdir* and *template* variables. To "
"maintain backward compatibility, the argument order is somewhat odd; it is "
"recommended to use keyword arguments for clarity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:28
msgid "The module defines the following user-callable functions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:32
msgid ""
"Return a :term:`file-like object` that can be used as a temporary storage "
"area. The file is created using :func:`mkstemp`. It will be destroyed as "
"soon as it is closed (including an implicit close when the object is garbage "
"collected).  Under Unix, the directory entry for the file is removed "
"immediately after the file is created.  Other platforms do not support this; "
"your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this function "
"having or not having a visible name in the file system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:40
msgid ""
"The *mode* parameter defaults to ``'w+b'`` so that the file created can be "
"read and written without being closed.  Binary mode is used so that it "
"behaves consistently on all platforms without regard for the data that is "
"stored.  *buffering*, *encoding* and *newline* are interpreted as for :func:"
"`open`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:46
msgid ""
"The *dir*, *prefix* and *suffix* parameters are passed to :func:`mkstemp`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:48
msgid ""
"The returned object is a true file object on POSIX platforms.  On other "
"platforms, it is a file-like object whose :attr:`!file` attribute is the "
"underlying true file object. This file-like object can be used in a :keyword:"
"`with` statement, just like a normal file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:56
msgid ""
"This function operates exactly as :func:`TemporaryFile` does, except that "
"the file is guaranteed to have a visible name in the file system (on Unix, "
"the directory entry is not unlinked).  That name can be retrieved from the :"
"attr:`name` member of the file object.  Whether the name can be used to open "
"the file a second time, while the named temporary file is still open, varies "
"across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot on Windows NT or "
"later).  If *delete* is true (the default), the file is deleted as soon as "
"it is closed. The returned object is always a file-like object whose :attr:`!"
"file` attribute is the underlying true file object. This file-like object "
"can be used in a :keyword:`with` statement, just like a normal file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:71
msgid ""
"This function operates exactly as :func:`TemporaryFile` does, except that "
"data is spooled in memory until the file size exceeds *max_size*, or until "
"the file's :func:`fileno` method is called, at which point the contents are "
"written to disk and operation proceeds as with :func:`TemporaryFile`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:77
msgid ""
"The resulting file has one additional method, :func:`rollover`, which causes "
"the file to roll over to an on-disk file regardless of its size."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tempfile.rst:80
msgid ""
"The returned object is a file-like object whose :attr:`_file` attribute is "
"either a :class:`StringIO` object or a true file object, depending on "
"whether :func:`rollover` has been called. This file-like object can be used "
"in a :keyword:`with` statement, just like a normal file."

msgid ""
"Creates a temporary file in the most secure manner possible.  There are no "
"race conditions in the file's creation, assuming that the platform properly "
"implements the :const:`os.O_EXCL` flag for :func:`os.open`.  The file is "
"readable and writable only by the creating user ID.  If the platform uses "
"permission bits to indicate whether a file is executable, the file is "
"executable by no one.  The file descriptor is not inherited by child "
"processes."

"If *suffix* is specified, the file name will end with that suffix, otherwise "

"*suffix*."

"If *dir* is specified, the file will be created in that directory; "

"from a platform-dependent list, but the user of the application can control "
"the directory location by setting the *TMPDIR*, *TEMP* or *TMP* environment "
"variables.  There is thus no guarantee that the generated filename will have "
"any nice properties, such as not requiring quoting when passed to external "
"commands via ``os.popen()``."
