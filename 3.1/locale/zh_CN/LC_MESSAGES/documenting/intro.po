"Python's documentation has long been considered to be good for a free "
"programming language.  There are a number of reasons for this, the most "
"important being the early commitment of Python's creator, Guido van Rossum, "
"to providing documentation on the language and its libraries, and the "
"continuing involvement of the user community in providing assistance for "
"creating and maintaining documentation."

"The involvement of the community takes many forms, from authoring to bug "
"reports to just plain complaining when the documentation could be more "
"complete or easier to use."

"This document is aimed at authors and potential authors of documentation for "
"Python.  More specifically, it is for people contributing to the standard "
"documentation and developing additional documents using the same tools as "
"the standard documents.  This guide will be less useful for authors using "
"the Python documentation tools for topics other than Python, and less useful "
"still for authors not using the tools at all."

"If your interest is in contributing to the Python documentation, but you "
"don't have the time or inclination to learn reStructuredText and the markup "
"structures documented here, there's a welcoming place for you among the "
"Python contributors as well.  Any time you feel that you can clarify "
"existing documentation or provide documentation that's missing, the existing "
"documentation team will gladly work with you to integrate your text, dealing "
"with the markup for you. Please don't let the material in this document "
"stand between the documentation and your desire to help out!"
