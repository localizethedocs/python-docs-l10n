"So far we've encountered two ways of writing values: *expression statements* "
"and the :func:`print` function.  (A third way is using the :meth:`write` "
"method of file objects; the standard output file can be referenced as ``sys."
"stdout``. See the Library Reference for more information on this.)"

"Often you'll want more control over the formatting of your output than "
"simply printing space-separated values.  There are two ways to format your "
"output; the first way is to do all the string handling yourself; using "
"string slicing and concatenation operations you can create any layout you "
"can imagine.  The string type has some methods that perform useful "
"operations for padding strings to a given column width; these will be "
"discussed shortly.  The second way is to use the :meth:`str.format` method."

"One question remains, of course: how do you convert values to strings? "
"Luckily, Python has ways to convert any value to a string: pass it to the :"
"func:`repr` or :func:`str` functions."

msgid ""
"The :func:`str` function is meant to return representations of values which "
"are fairly human-readable, while :func:`repr` is meant to generate "
"representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a :exc:"
"`SyntaxError` if there is not equivalent syntax).  For objects which don't "
"have a particular representation for human consumption, :func:`str` will "
"return the same value as :func:`repr`.  Many values, such as numbers or "
"structures like lists and dictionaries, have the same representation using "
"either function.  Strings and floating point numbers, in particular, have "
"two distinct representations."

"This example demonstrates the :meth:`str.rjust` method of string objects, "
"which right-justifies a string in a field of a given width by padding it "
"with spaces on the left.  There are similar methods :meth:`str.ljust` and :"
"meth:`str.center`.  These methods do not write anything, they just return a "
"new string.  If the input string is too long, they don't truncate it, but "
"return it unchanged; this will mess up your column lay-out but that's "
"usually better than the alternative, which would be lying about a value.  "

"erased), and ``'a'`` opens the file for appending; any data written to the "

"``f.readlines()`` returns a list containing all the lines of data in the "

"lines, but without having to load the entire file in memory.  Only complete "
