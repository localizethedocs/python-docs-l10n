msgid ""
"The :mod:`tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source "
"code, implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as "
"tokens as well, making it useful for implementing \"pretty-printers,\" "
"including colorizers for on-screen displays."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tokenize.rst:15
msgid "The primary entry point is a :term:`generator`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tokenize.rst:19
msgid ""
"The :func:`tokenize` generator requires one argument, *readline*, which must "
"be a callable object which provides the same interface as the :meth:`io."
"IOBase.readline` method of file objects.  Each call to the function should "
"return one line of input as bytes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tokenize.rst:24
msgid ""
"The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the "
"token string; a 2-tuple ``(srow, scol)`` of ints specifying the row and "
"column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple ``(erow, ecol)`` of "
"ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and "
"the line on which the token was found. The line passed (the last tuple item) "
"is the *logical* line; continuation lines are included.  The 5 tuple is "
"returned as a :term:`named tuple` with the field names: ``type string start "
"end line``."

"Token value used to indicate a non-terminating newline.  The NEWLINE token "
"indicates the end of a logical line of Python code; NL tokens are generated "

"Token value that indicates the encoding used to decode the source bytes into "
"text. The first token returned by :func:`tokenize` will always be an "

"Another function is provided to reverse the tokenization process. This is "
"useful for creating tools that tokenize a script, modify the token stream, "
"and write back the modified script."

#: ../../../library/tokenize.rst:69
msgid ""
"Converts tokens back into Python source code.  The *iterable* must return "
"sequences with at least two elements, the token type and the token string. "
"Any additional sequence elements are ignored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tokenize.rst:73
msgid ""
"The reconstructed script is returned as a single string.  The result is "
"guaranteed to tokenize back to match the input so that the conversion is "
"lossless and round-trips are assured.  The guarantee applies only to the "
"token type and token string as the spacing between tokens (column positions) "
"may change."

msgid ""
"The :func:`detect_encoding` function is used to detect the encoding that "
"should be used to decode a Python source file. It requires one argument, "
"readline, in the same way as the :func:`tokenize` generator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/tokenize.rst:92
msgid ""
"It will call readline a maximum of twice, and return the encoding used (as a "
"string) and a list of any lines (not decoded from bytes) it has read in."

msgid ""
"It detects the encoding from the presence of a UTF-8 BOM or an encoding "
"cookie as specified in :pep:`263`. If both a BOM and a cookie are present, "
