"These APIs are a minimal emulation of the Python 2 C API for built-in file "
"objects, which used to rely on the buffered I/O (:ctype:`FILE\\*`) support "
"from the C standard library.  In Python 3, files and streams use the new :"
"mod:`io` module, which defines several layers over the low-level unbuffered "
"I/O of the operating system.  The functions described below are convenience "
"C wrappers over these new APIs, and meant mostly for internal error "
"reporting in the interpreter; third-party code is advised to access the :mod:"
"`io` APIs instead."
