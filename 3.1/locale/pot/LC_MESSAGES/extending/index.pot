"This document describes how to write modules in C or C++ to extend the "
"Python interpreter with new modules.  Those modules can define new functions "
"but also new object types and their methods.  The document also describes "
"how to embed the Python interpreter in another application, for use as an "
"extension language. Finally, it shows how to compile and link extension "
"modules so that they can be loaded dynamically (at run time) into the "
"interpreter, if the underlying operating system supports this feature."

"This document assumes basic knowledge about Python.  For an informal "
"introduction to the language, see :ref:`tutorial-index`.  :ref:`reference-"
"index` gives a more formal definition of the language.  :ref:`library-index` "
"documents the existing object types, functions and modules (both built-in "
"and written in Python) that give the language its wide application range."
