"The :mod:`stat` module defines constants and functions for interpreting the "
"results of :func:`os.stat`, :func:`os.fstat` and :func:`os.lstat` (if they "
"exist).  For complete details about the :cfunc:`stat`, :cfunc:`fstat` and :"
"cfunc:`lstat` calls, consult the documentation for your system."

"The interpretation of \"file size\" changes according to the file type.  For "

"under most flavors of Unix (including Linux in particular), the \"size\" is "
"the number of bytes waiting to be read at the time of the call to :func:`os."
"stat`, :func:`os.fstat`, or :func:`os.lstat`; this can sometimes be useful, "
