"The :mod:`mimetypes` module converts between a filename or URL and the MIME "
"type associated with the filename extension.  Conversions are provided from "
"filename to MIME type and from MIME type to filename extension; encodings "
"are not supported for the latter conversion."

"functions are the normal interface to this module, but some applications may "
"be interested in the class as well."

"Guess the type of a file based on its filename or URL, given by *filename*.  "
"The return value is a tuple ``(type, encoding)`` where *type* is ``None`` if "
"the type can't be guessed (missing or unknown suffix) or a string of the "
"form ``'type/subtype'``, usable for a MIME :mailheader:`content-type` header."

"*encoding* is ``None`` for no encoding or the name of the program used to "
"encode (e.g. :program:`compress` or :program:`gzip`). The encoding is "
"suitable for use as a :mailheader:`Content-Encoding` header, *not* as a :"
"mailheader:`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header. The mappings are table "
"driven. Encoding suffixes are case sensitive; type suffixes are first tried "
"case sensitively, then case insensitively."
