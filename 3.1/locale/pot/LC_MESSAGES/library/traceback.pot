msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/traceback.rst:8
msgid ""
"This module provides a standard interface to extract, format and print stack "
"traces of Python programs.  It exactly mimics the behavior of the Python "
"interpreter when it prints a stack trace.  This is useful when you want to "
"print stack traces under program control, such as in a \"wrapper\" around "
"the interpreter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/traceback.rst:16
msgid ""
"The module uses traceback objects --- this is the object type that is stored "
"in the :data:`sys.last_traceback` variable and returned as the third item "
"from :func:`sys.exc_info`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/traceback.rst:20
msgid "The module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/traceback.rst:25
msgid ""
"Print up to *limit* stack trace entries from *traceback*.  If *limit* is "
"omitted or ``None``, all entries are printed. If *file* is omitted or "
"``None``, the output goes to ``sys.stderr``; otherwise it should be an open "
"file or file-like object to receive the output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/traceback.rst:33
msgid ""
"Print exception information and up to *limit* stack trace entries from "
"*traceback* to *file*. This differs from :func:`print_tb` in the following "
"ways:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/traceback.rst:37
msgid ""
"if *traceback* is not ``None``, it prints a header ``Traceback (most recent "
"call last):``"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/traceback.rst:40
msgid ""
"if *type* is :exc:`SyntaxError` and *value* has the appropriate format, it "
"prints the line where the syntax error occurred with a caret indicating the "
"approximate position of the error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *chain* is true (the default), then chained exceptions (the :attr:"

"exception."

"This is a shorthand for ``print_exception(sys.last_type, sys.last_value, sys."

"exception has reached an interactive prompt (see :data:`sys.last_type`)."
msgstr ""

"This function prints a stack trace from its invocation point.  The optional "
"*f* argument can be used to specify an alternate stack frame to start.  The "
"optional *limit* and *file* arguments have the same meaning as for :func:"
"`print_exception`."

"Return a list of up to *limit* \"pre-processed\" stack trace entries "
"extracted from the traceback object *traceback*.  It is useful for alternate "
"formatting of stack traces.  If *limit* is omitted or ``None``, all entries "
"are extracted.  A \"pre-processed\" stack trace entry is a quadruple "
"(*filename*, *line number*, *function name*, *text*) representing the "
"information that is usually printed for a stack trace.  The *text* is a "
"string with leading and trailing whitespace stripped; if the source is not "
"available it is ``None``."

"The return value is a list of strings, each ending in a newline.  Normally, "
"the list contains a single string; however, for :exc:`SyntaxError` "
"exceptions, it contains several lines that (when printed) display detailed "
"information about where the syntax error occurred.  The message indicating "
