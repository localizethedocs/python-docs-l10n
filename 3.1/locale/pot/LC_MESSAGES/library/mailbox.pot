"class:`Mailbox` offers a dictionary-like mapping from keys to messages. :"

"Maildir, mbox, MH, Babyl, and MMDF."

"The :class:`Mailbox` interface is dictionary-like, with small keys "

msgid ""
":class:`Mailbox` interface semantics differ from dictionary semantics in "
"some noteworthy ways. Each time a message is requested, a new representation "
"(typically a :class:`Message` instance) is generated based upon the current "
"state of the mailbox. Similarly, when a message is added to a :class:"
"`Mailbox` instance, the provided message representation's contents are "
"copied. In neither case is a reference to the message representation kept by "
"the :class:`Mailbox` instance."

"The default :class:`Mailbox` iterator iterates over message representations, "
"not keys as the default dictionary iterator does. Moreover, modification of "
"a mailbox during iteration is safe and well-defined. Messages added to the "
"mailbox after an iterator is created will not be seen by the iterator. "
"Messages removed from the mailbox before the iterator yields them will be "
"silently skipped, though using a key from an iterator may result in a :exc:"
"`KeyError` exception if the corresponding message is subsequently removed."

"Be very cautious when modifying mailboxes that might be simultaneously "
"changed by some other process.  The safest mailbox format to use for such "

"concurrent writing.  If you're modifying a mailbox, you *must* lock it by "
"calling the :meth:`lock` and :meth:`unlock` methods *before* reading any "
