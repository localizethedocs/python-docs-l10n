"This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files "
"just like the GNU programs :program:`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` would."

"The :mod:`gzip` module provides the :class:`GzipFile` class. The :class:"
"`GzipFile` class reads and writes :program:`gzip`\\ -format files, "
"automatically compressing or decompressing the data so that it looks like an "
"ordinary :term:`file object`."

msgid ""
"Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the :program:"
"`gzip` and :program:`gunzip` programs, such  as those produced by :program:"
"`compress` and :program:`pack`, are not supported by this module."

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:28
msgid ""
"Constructor for the :class:`GzipFile` class, which simulates most of the "
"methods of a :term:`file object`, with the exception of the :meth:`readinto` "
"and :meth:`truncate` methods.  At least one of *fileobj* and *filename* must "
"be given a non-trivial value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:33
msgid ""
"The new class instance is based on *fileobj*, which can be a regular file, "
"a :class:`StringIO` object, or any other object which simulates a file.  It "
"defaults to ``None``, in which case *filename* is opened to provide a file "
"object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:38
msgid ""
"When *fileobj* is not ``None``, the *filename* argument is only used to be "
"included in the :program:`gzip` file header, which may includes the original "
"filename of the uncompressed file.  It defaults to the filename of "
"*fileobj*, if discernible; otherwise, it defaults to the empty string, and "
"in this case the original filename is not included in the header."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:44
msgid ""
"The *mode* argument can be any of ``'r'``, ``'rb'``, ``'a'``, ``'ab'``, "
"``'w'``, or ``'wb'``, depending on whether the file will be read or "
"written.  The default is the mode of *fileobj* if discernible; otherwise, "
"the default is ``'rb'``. If not given, the 'b' flag will be added to the "
"mode to ensure the file is opened in binary mode for cross-platform "
"portability."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:50
msgid ""
"The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from ``1`` to ``9`` controlling "
"the level of compression; ``1`` is fastest and produces the least "
"compression, and ``9`` is slowest and produces the most compression.  The "
"default is ``9``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:54
msgid ""
"The *mtime* argument is an optional numeric timestamp to be written to the "
"stream when compressing.  All :program:`gzip` compressed streams are "
"required to contain a timestamp.  If omitted or ``None``, the current time "
"is used.  This module ignores the timestamp when decompressing; however, "
"some programs, such as :program:`gunzip`\\ , make use of it. The format of "
"the timestamp is the same as that of the return value of ``time.time()`` and "
"of the ``st_mtime`` member of the object returned by ``os.stat()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/gzip.rst:63
msgid ""
"Calling a :class:`GzipFile` object's :meth:`close` method does not close "
"*fileobj*, since you might wish to append more material after the compressed "
"data.  This also allows you to pass a :class:`StringIO` object opened for "
"writing as *fileobj*, and retrieve the resulting memory buffer using the :"
"class:`StringIO` object's :meth:`getvalue` method."
