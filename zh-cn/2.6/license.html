<h2>History of the software<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-the-software" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cwi.nl/">http://www.cwi.nl/</a>) in the Netherlands as a
successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python’s principal author,
although it includes many contributions from others.</p>
<p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/">http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/</a>) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.</p>
<p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to
form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs
team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.zope.com/">http://www.zope.com/</a>).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/">http://www.python.org/psf/</a>) was formed, a non-profit organization created
specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a
sponsoring member of the PSF.</p>
<p>All Python releases are Open Source (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</a> for the Open
Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also
been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.</p>

Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
text is available at
      http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
(section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
copyrighted.

The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
&lt;ghost@aladdin.com&gt;.  Other authors are noted in the change history
that follows (in reverse chronological order):

2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
      references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
      now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
      added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
      Purschke &lt;purschke@bnl.gov&gt;.
1999-05-03 lpd Original version.

Modified by Jack Jansen, CWI, July 1995:
- Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
  between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
  version is still 5 times faster, though.
- Arguments more compliant with Python standard
