"This document describes how to write modules in C or C++ to extend the "
"Python interpreter with new modules.  Those modules can do what Python code "
"does -- define functions, object types and methods -- but also interact with "
"native libraries or achieve better performance by avoiding the overhead of "
"an interpreter.  The document also describes how to embed the Python "
"interpreter in another application, for use as an extension language.  "
"Finally, it shows how to compile and link extension modules so that they can "
"be loaded dynamically (at run time) into the interpreter, if the underlying "
"operating system supports this feature."

"introduction to Python, see :ref:`tutorial-index`.  :ref:`reference-index` "
"gives a more formal definition of the language.  :ref:`library-index` "
"documents the existing object types, functions and modules (both built-in "
"and written in Python) that give the language its wide application range."

"To support extensions, Python's C API (Application Programmers Interface) "
"defines a set of functions, macros and variables that provide access to most "
"aspects of the Python run-time system.  The Python API is incorporated in a "
"C source file by including the header ``\"Python.h\"``."

msgid ""
"The C extension interface is specific to CPython, and extension modules do "
"not work on other Python implementations.  In many cases, it is possible to "
"avoid writing C extensions and preserve portability to other "
"implementations. For example, if your use case is calling C library "
"functions or system calls, you should consider using the :mod:`ctypes` "
"module or the `cffi <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/>`_ library rather than "
"writing custom C code. These modules let you write Python code to interface "
"with C code and are more portable between implementations of Python than "
"writing and compiling a C extension module."
