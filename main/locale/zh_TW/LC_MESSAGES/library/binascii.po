"The :mod:`!binascii` module contains a number of methods to convert between "
"binary and various ASCII-encoded binary representations. Normally, you will "
"not use these functions directly but use wrapper modules like :mod:`base64` "

"C for greater speed that are used by the higher-level modules."
