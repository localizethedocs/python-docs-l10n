"A new statistical sampling profiler has been added to the :mod:`profile` "

"Unlike deterministic profilers (:mod:`cProfile` and :mod:`profile`) that "
"instrument every function call, the sampling profiler periodically captures "
"stack traces from running processes.  This approach provides virtually zero "
"overhead while achieving sampling rates of **up to 1,000,000 Hz**, making it "
"the fastest sampling profiler available for Python (at the time of its "
"contribution) and ideal for debugging performance issues in production "
