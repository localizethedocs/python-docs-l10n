"Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting "
"Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a "
"successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal "
"author, although it includes many contributions from others."

"In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National "

"In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com "
"to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the "

"In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/"
