"A :dfn:`profile` is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how "

"statistical sampling and deterministic tracing."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/profiling.rst:104
msgid ""
"One of the main strengths of the sampling profiler is its variety of output "
"formats. Beyond traditional pstats tables, it can generate interactive "
"flamegraphs that visualize call hierarchies, line-level source heatmaps that "
"show exactly where time is spent in your code, and Firefox Profiler output "
"for timeline-based analysis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/profiling.rst:110
msgid ""
"The profiler also provides insight into Python interpreter behavior that "
"deterministic profiling cannot capture. Use ``--mode gil`` to identify GIL "
"contention in multi-threaded code, ``--mode cpu`` to measure actual CPU time "
"excluding I/O waits, or inspect ``<GC>`` frames to understand garbage "
"collection overhead. The ``--native`` option reveals time spent in C "
"extensions, helping distinguish Python overhead from library performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/profiling.rst:117
msgid ""
"For multi-threaded applications, the ``-a`` option samples all threads "
"simultaneously, showing how work is distributed. And for production "
"debugging, the ``attach`` command connects to any running Python process by "
"PID without requiring a restart or code changes."

"but guarantees complete coverage of program execution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/profiling.rst:130
msgid ""
"The primary reason to choose deterministic tracing is when you need exact "
"call counts. Statistical profiling estimates frequency based on sampling, "
"which may undercount short-lived functions that complete between samples. If "
"you need to verify that an optimization actually reduced the number of "
"function calls, or if you want to trace the complete call graph to "
"understand caller-callee relationships, deterministic tracing is the right "
"choice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/profiling.rst:137

"Deterministic tracing also excels at capturing functions that execute in "
"microseconds. Such functions may not appear frequently enough in statistical "
