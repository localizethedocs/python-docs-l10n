"The Document Object Model, or \"DOM,\" is a cross-language API from the "
"World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for accessing and modifying XML documents.  "
"A DOM implementation presents an XML document as a tree structure, or allows "
"client code to build such a structure from scratch.  It then gives access to "
"the structure through a set of objects which provided well-known interfaces."

msgid ""
"The DOM is extremely useful for random-access applications.  SAX only allows "
"you a view of one bit of the document at a time.  If you are looking at one "
"SAX element, you have no access to another.  If you are looking at a text "
"node, you have no access to a containing element. When you write a SAX "
"application, you need to keep track of your program's position in the "
"document somewhere in your own code.  SAX does not do it for you.  Also, if "
"you need to look ahead in the XML document, you are just out of luck."

"Some applications are simply impossible in an event driven model with no "
"access to a tree.  Of course you could build some sort of tree yourself in "

"DOM applications typically start by parsing some XML into a DOM.  How this "
"is accomplished is not covered at all by DOM Level 1, and Level 2 provides "
"only limited improvements: There is a :class:`DOMImplementation` object "
"class which provides access to :class:`Document` creation methods, but no "
"way to access an XML reader/parser/Document builder in an implementation-"
"independent way. There is also no well-defined way to access these methods "
"without an existing :class:`Document` object.  In Python, each DOM "
"implementation will provide a function :func:`getDOMImplementation`. DOM "

"reader, but this is not yet available in the Python standard library."
