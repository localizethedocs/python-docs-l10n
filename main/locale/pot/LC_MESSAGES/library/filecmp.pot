"Compare the files named *f1* and *f2*, returning ``True`` if they seem "
"equal, ``False`` otherwise."

"Returns three lists of file names: *match*, *mismatch*, *errors*.  *match* "
"contains the list of files that match, *mismatch* contains the names of "
"those that don't, and *errors* lists the names of files which could not be "
"compared.  Files are listed in *errors* if they don't exist in one of the "

"could not be done for some other reason."
