"The :mod:`profiling.tracing` module provides deterministic profiling of "
"Python programs. It monitors every function call, function return, and "
"exception event, recording precise timing for each. This approach provides "
"exact call counts and complete visibility into program execution, making it "
"ideal for development and testing scenarios."

":dfn:`Deterministic profiling` captures every function call, function "
"return, and exception event during program execution. The profiler measures "
"the precise time intervals between these events, providing exact statistics "
"about how the program behaves."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/profiling.tracing.rst:49
msgid ""
"In contrast to :ref:`statistical profiling <profiling-sampling>`, which "
"samples the call stack periodically to estimate where time is spent, "
"deterministic profiling records every event. This means you get exact call "
"counts rather than statistical approximations. The trade-off is that "
"instrumenting every event introduces overhead that can slow down program "
"execution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../library/profiling.tracing.rst:55
msgid ""
"Python's interpreted nature makes deterministic profiling practical. The "
"interpreter already dispatches events for function calls and returns, so the "
"profiler can hook into this mechanism without requiring code modification. "
"The overhead tends to be moderate relative to the inherent cost of "
"interpretation, making deterministic profiling suitable for most development "
"workflows."

"There is also latency between when an event occurs and when the profiler "
