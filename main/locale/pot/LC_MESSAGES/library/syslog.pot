"Send the string *message* to the system logger.  A trailing newline is added "
"if necessary.  Each message is tagged with a priority composed of a "
"*facility* and a *level*.  The optional *priority* argument, which defaults "
"to :const:`LOG_INFO`, determines the message priority.  If the facility is "
"not encoded in *priority* using logical-or (``LOG_INFO | LOG_USER``), the "
"value given in the :func:`openlog` call is used."
