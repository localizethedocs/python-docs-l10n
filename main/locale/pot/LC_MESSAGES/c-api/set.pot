"This subtype of :c:type:`PyObject` is used to hold the internal data for "
"both :class:`set` and :class:`frozenset` objects.  It is like a :c:type:"
"`PyDictObject` in that it is a fixed size for small sets (much like tuple "
"storage) and will point to a separate, variable sized block of memory for "
"medium and large sized sets (much like list storage). None of the fields of "
"this structure should be considered public and all are subject to change.  "
"All access should be done through the documented API rather than by "
"manipulating the values in the structure."
