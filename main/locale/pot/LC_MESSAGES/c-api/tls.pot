"The Python interpreter provides low-level support for thread-local storage "
"(TLS) which wraps the underlying native TLS implementation to support the "
"Python-level thread-local storage API (:class:`threading.local`).  The "
"CPython C level APIs are similar to those offered by pthreads and Windows: "
"use a thread key and functions to associate a :c:expr:`void*` value per "
"thread."
