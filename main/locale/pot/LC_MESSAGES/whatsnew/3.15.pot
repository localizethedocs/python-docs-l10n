msgid ":pep:`810`: Explicit lazy imports"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew/3.15.rst:94
msgid ""
"Large Python applications often suffer from slow startup times. A "
"significant contributor to this problem is the import system: when a module "
"is imported, Python must locate the file, read it from disk, compile it to "
"bytecode, and execute all top-level code. For applications with deep "
"dependency trees, this process can take seconds, even when most of the "
"imported code is never actually used during a particular run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew/3.15.rst:101
msgid ""
"Developers have worked around this by moving imports inside functions, "
"using :mod:`importlib` to load modules on demand, or restructuring code to "
"avoid unnecessary dependencies. These approaches work but make code harder "
"to read and maintain, scatter import statements throughout the codebase, and "
"require discipline to apply consistently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew/3.15.rst:107
msgid ""
"Python now provides a cleaner solution through explicit :keyword:`lazy` "
"imports using the new ``lazy`` soft keyword. When you mark an import as "
"lazy, Python defers the actual module loading until the imported name is "
"first used. This gives you the organizational benefits of declaring all "
"imports at the top of the file while only paying the loading cost for "
"modules you actually use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew/3.15.rst:114
msgid ""
"The ``lazy`` keyword works with both ``import`` and ``from ... import`` "
"statements. When you write ``lazy import heavy_module``, Python does not "
"immediately load the module. Instead, it creates a lightweight proxy object. "
"The actual module loading happens transparently when you first access the "
"name:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew/3.15.rst:130
msgid ""
"This mechanism is particularly useful for applications that import many "
"modules at the top level but may only use a subset of them in any given run. "
"The deferred loading reduces startup latency without requiring code "
"restructuring or conditional imports scattered throughout the codebase."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew/3.15.rst:135
msgid ""
"In the case where loading a lazily imported module fails (for example, if "
"the module does not exist), Python raises the exception at the point of "
"first use rather than at import time. The associated traceback includes both "
"the location where the name was accessed and the original import statement, "
"making it straightforward to diagnose & debug the failure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew/3.15.rst:141
msgid ""
"For cases where you want to enable lazy loading globally without modifying "
"source code, Python provides the :option:`-X lazy_imports <-X>` command-line "
"option and the :envvar:`PYTHON_LAZY_IMPORTS` environment variable. Both "
"accept three values: ``all`` makes all imports lazy by default, ``none`` "
"disables lazy imports entirely (even explicit ``lazy`` statements become "
"eager), and ``normal`` (the default) respects the ``lazy`` keyword in source "
"code. The :func:`sys.set_lazy_imports` and :func:`sys.get_lazy_imports` "
"functions allow changing and querying this mode at runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../whatsnew/3.15.rst:150
msgid ""
"For more selective control, :func:`sys.set_lazy_imports_filter` accepts a "
"callable that determines whether a specific module should be loaded lazily. "
"The filter receives three arguments: the importing module's name (or "
"``None``), the imported module's name, and the fromlist (or ``None`` for "
"regular imports). It should return ``True`` to allow the import to be lazy, "
"or ``False`` to force eager loading. This allows patterns like making only "
"your own application's modules lazy while keeping third-party dependencies "
"eager:"

"There are some restrictions on where the ``lazy`` keyword can be used. Lazy "
"imports are only permitted at module scope; using ``lazy`` inside a "

"`SyntaxError`. Neither star imports nor future imports can be lazy (``lazy "
